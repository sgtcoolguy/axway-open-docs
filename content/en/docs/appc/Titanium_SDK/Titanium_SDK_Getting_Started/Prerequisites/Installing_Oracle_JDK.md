## Compatibility and download

Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to be installed in order to work with Titanium.

Be aware that no other flavors of JDK, such as OpenJDK, currently work with Titanium; only Oracle's will suffice.

Titanium supports the following versions of JDK for each respective Operating System:

*   On Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier, the JDK is preinstalled.
    
*   On Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later, the OS should prompt you to install it when needed.

**32-bit** (x86 / i586) (see note)

[Official Website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

*   The 32-bit version of the JDK is required regardless of whether Titanium is running on a 32-bit Windows system.
    
*   Studio offers to install JDK 8 if no JDK is found.
    

**Note**: From Studio 5.1.0 and up, 64-bit JDK is supported

## Installation

### OS X

Note that the typical file system location of this software can be found in the [mac OS Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#macOSSoftwareLocations) section of these guides.

Oracle JDK is installed by default on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier.

On Mac OS X 10.7 and later, the OS should prompt you to install it. You can also go to [Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) and search 'java' to download the installer.

If you are developing Android applications on your OS X system, you need to install the Java 6 runtime. For details, see [https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572).

### Windows

Note that the typical file system location of this software can be found in the [Windows Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#WindowsSoftwareLocations) section of these guides.

*   Log in under your usual user account, and right-click the Windows Installer and select _Run as administrator_. Enter the Administrator password, if you are prompted for it, and proceed until the first screenshot below.
    
*   At the **Java SE Development Kit - Custom Setup** > **Install to** step, select the **Development Tools** component and verify that it is in the location suggested in the [Windows Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#WindowsSoftwareLocations) section. If not, correct it accordingly. Proceed to the following screenshot below.
    
*   Select the **Public JRE** component and verify that it is in the location suggested in the [Windows Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#WindowsSoftwareLocations) section. If not, correct it accordingly.

    ![jdk8-install-02](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004850/jdk8-install-02.png)

*   Wait for the JDK installation to complete. The JRE installation will start automatically.
    
*   At the **Java Setup** > **Destination Folder** step, verify that the **Install to** path is the same location suggested in the [Windows Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#WindowsSoftwareLocations) section. If not, correct it accordingly.
    
    ![jdk8-install-03](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004850/jdk8-install-03.png)

*   Complete the installation.
    

Refer to the [Windows Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#WindowsSoftwareLocations) section to add the path to the Oracle JDK bin directory to your system's PATH and set the JAVA\_HOME variable.

### Ubuntu

Note that the typical file system location of this software can be found in the [Ubuntu Software Locations](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/#UbuntuSoftwareLocations) section of these guides.

See the [Software Locations and Environment Variables](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/) guide if you need help with setting your system PATH or other system variables.

To install the Oracle JDK, enable the archive repositories and install the package using the apt-get command:

`sudo` `add-apt-repository` `"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"`

`sudo` `add-apt-repository` `"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hardy main multiverse"`

`sudo` `apt-get update`

`sudo` `apt-get` `install` `oracle-java8-installer`

If installing the 64-bit JDK, run sudo apt-get install ia32-libs.

If you have more than one Java installation, run sudo update-alternatives --config java then select java-8-oracle as default.

Alternatively, you can download and launch the installation package from Oracle.

## Testing the installation

Run the following commands from the command-line or terminal on any operating system to determine whether JDK has been installed and configured correctly:

`java -version`

`javac -version`

You should receive results similar to the following, where both commands are recognized and return the correct version.

`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.248]`

`(c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.`

`C:\Users\appcel>java` `-version`

`java version` `"1.8.0_162"`

`Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_162-b12)`

`Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.162-b12, mixed mode)`

`C:\Users\appcel>javac` `-version`

`javac 1.8.0_162`
