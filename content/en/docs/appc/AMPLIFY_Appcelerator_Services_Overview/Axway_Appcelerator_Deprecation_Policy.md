{"title":"Axway Appcelerator Deprecation Policy","weight":"30"} 

## Deprecation definition

Deprecation should be interpreted as an announcement and warning that the version of a component, artifact, API, or service will soon be removed or disabled. Versions are deprecated rather than immediately removed to give developers time to bring affected code into up to date versions. Developers are encouraged to upgrade their code before the deprecation period ends, at that time the version is no longer available or supported.

## Axway Appcelerator deprecation policy

The Axway Appcelerator Mobile solution is based on multiple components, features, artifacts, and services with distinct versions and release life cycles according to [Axway Appcelerator Product Lifecycle](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Product_Lifecycle/). Functionality naturally evolves over time, and sometimes software may need to be removed or disabled. To avoid breaking changes that affect users functionality, Axway follows a deprecation policy for software that are slated to be removed. Axway will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide **advance notice of minimum 6 months** of deprecation of a components, features, artifact, or services, and at the end of deprecation period, will remove the deprecated software. Deprecated functionality will not be supported in future major releases of a product, for example from 5.y.z to 6.y.z. For the most recent list of deprecated functionality within a particular major release, refer to the latest version of release documentation.

## APIs deprecation

When Axway adds, updates, or removes existing Axway Appcelerator APIs, Axway will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of minimum 6 months of any material, permanent suspension, or discontinuation of API functionality. Axway will use commercially reasonable efforts to support any deprecated API for the duration of the current major release according to [Axway Appcelerator Product Lifecycle](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Product_Lifecycle/).

## Deprecated Third Party Software Support

Axway will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of any material, permanent suspension, or discontinuation of third party software support. Axway will also use commercially reasonable efforts to support any deprecated third party software support for the duration of the current major release according to Axway Appcelerator Product Lifecycle. Only if the third party vendor does not ends support or availability before the end of a product life cycle, third party software life cycles are out of Axway's control and can be discounted without advanced notice.

For example, Microsoft terminated support for Windows Phone 8.1 which would imply termination for Axway Appcelerator support that to it's components, artifacts, APIs, and/or services.
