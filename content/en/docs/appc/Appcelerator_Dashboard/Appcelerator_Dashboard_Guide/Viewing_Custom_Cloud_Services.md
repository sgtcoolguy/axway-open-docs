If you created an API Builder application and associated it with your organization, or the client application makes requests to an API Builder application using the Titanium HTTP client, you can view information about the API Builder application in Dashboard. To associate an API Builder application with a client application built with Java or Objective-C, you need to add a x-native-id header to the HTTP request.
