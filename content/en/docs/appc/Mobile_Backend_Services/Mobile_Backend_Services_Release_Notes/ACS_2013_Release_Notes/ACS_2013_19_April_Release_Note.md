{"title":"Session expiration policy update","weight":"90"}

On May 15th, Appcelerator will start enforcing a new expiration policy for user sessions. Previously, user sessions were never removed from the database, no matter how long they had been idle.

Starting May 15th, user login sessions will expire after they have been unused for a period of time. By default, the expiration period is six months. You can configure the user session expiration period in the application management console.
