# Widget Configuration File (widget.json)

All widgets have a configuration file called widget.json located in the root directory of the widget. The configuration file follows the [npm package.json format](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) with a few exceptions.

The widget configuration file also accepts the following key-value pairs:

Key

Value

Description

id

String

**Mandatory.** Needs to be the same name as the widget root folder.

copyright

String

Widget copyright information.

license

String

Widget license information.

min-alloy-version\*

Float

Minimum required Alloy version to run the widget.

min-titanium-version\*

Float

Minimum required Titanium version to run the widget.

tags

String

List of keywords.

platforms\*

Any combination of platforms (comma delimited)

Which platforms the widget will run on.

(\*) Currently, the min-alloy-version, min-titanium-version and platforms keys are not required, but in the future, Alloy will perform a check against these values.
