{"title":"Creating a Google API Console project and client ID","weight":"10"} 

Before you can integrate Google Sign-In into your website, you must have a Google API Console project. In the project, you create a client ID, which you need to call the sign-in API.

To create a Google API Console project and client ID, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/apis/library).
    
2.  From the project drop-down, select an existing [project](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158853), or create a new one by selecting **Create a new project**.
    
    Use a single project to hold all platform instances of your app (Android, iOS, web, etc.), each with a different Client ID.
    
3.  In the sidebar under "API Manager", select **Credentials**, then select the **OAuth consent screen** tab.
    
    1.  Choose an **Email Address**, specify a **Product Name**, and press **Save**.
        
4.  In the **Credentials** tab, select the **New credentials** drop-down list, and choose **OAuth client ID**.
    
5.  Under **Application type**, select **Web application**. Register the origins from which your app is allowed to access the Google APIs, as follows. An origin is a unique combination of protocol, hostname, and port.
    
    1.  In the **Authorized JavaScript origins** field, enter the origin for your app. You can enter multiple origins to allow for your app to run on different protocols, domains, or subdomains. You cannot use wildcards. In the example below, the second URL could be a production URL.
        
        `http:``//localhost:8080`
        
        `https:``//myproductionurl.example.com`
        
    2.  The **Authorized redirect URI** field does not require a value. Redirect URIs are not used with JavaScript APIs.
        
    3.  Press the **Create** button.
        
6.  From the resulting **OAuth client dialog box**, copy the **Client ID** . The Client ID lets your app access enabled Google APIs.
