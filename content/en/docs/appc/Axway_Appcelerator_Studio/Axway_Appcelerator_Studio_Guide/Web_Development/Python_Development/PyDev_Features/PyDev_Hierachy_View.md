{"title":"Hierachy View","weight":"120"} 

In PyDev you can use **F4** to open the hierarchy view for you while over some class definition.

The Hierarchy View allows you to check a class hierarchy, seeing the relations as well as methods and attributes for all the classes in the hierarchy.

After opening the hierarchy view, you can:

*   **Single-click** a class: will show you the class methods
    
*   **Double-click** a class, method or attribute: will open that definition in the editor.
    
*   **Zoom**: Right-Click the view and move your mouse left/right
    
*   **Pan**: Lef-Click the view and move your mouse as you wish
