# Switch between Xcode 4.3 and other Xcode versions (Xcode 4.2 and lower)

Appcelerator Studio, and the Titanium CLI, uses the **xcode-select** command (typically found in /usr/bin/xcode-select) to retrieve the desired Xcode installation. If you have multiple Xcode installations and need to switch what version Studio uses, you use the same command to select the desired XCode version.

**To switch the Xcode version used by Studio**:

1.  Open a Terminal window and execute the following command:
    
    `sudo xcode-select -``switch` `<xcode_folder_path>`
    
    The **<xcode\_folder\_path>** is typically /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer for Xcode 4.3 and later (or /Developer or /Developer-x.x for Xcode 4.2).
    
2.  In Studio, open the Studio Preferences and navigate to **Studio** > **Platforms** > **iOS.**
    
3.  In the iOS section, click the **Refresh** button.
    
4.  The newly specified Xcode folder path should be displayed.
    

You may need to restart Studio for your changes to take effect.
