## Overview

Studio does its best not to crash, but when it does, there are helpful pieces of information you can send to the developers.

## Freezes

A freeze is likely caused by either a deadlock in code or an infinite loop. To diagnose:

1. If you are on OS X or have the JDK installed on Windows, you can use the "jps" command

2. To check, try typing "jps" on the command line, or you may need to look in "c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk\_directory\\bin" or wherever your Java is installed. If you do not have a directory with "JDK" in the name, you won't be able to use JPS.

### Using JPS

On Unix, you may need to run the following commands as "sudo"

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Type **jps -v** shows you a list of jvm process ids. You should see one referencing Eclipse.

3. Type **jstack <pid> >> logfile.log**to dump the stack trace for the specified VM process id. Copy this into a file and attach it to the JIRA ticket. You may need to pipe the output to a location where you have write permissions, i.e.:

    1. c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0\_29\\bin>jstack 2616 >> "C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\test2.log"

Example:

`Machine$ jps -v`

`9528` `Jps -Dapplication.home=/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/``1.6``.``0``.jdk/Contents/Home -Xms8m`

`8455` `-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts -Xms40m -Xmx1024m -Declipse.p2.unsignedPolicy=allow -Declipse.log.size.max=``10000` `-Declipse.log.backup.max=``5` `-Xdock:icon=../Resources/titanium.icns -XstartOnFirstThread -Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts -XX:MaxPermSize=256m`

`Machine$ jstack` `8455` `>> logfile.log`

### Without JPS

Unfortunately, the easiest way requires restarting Studio on the command line. If that's not possible for some reason, you can use this free tool (though it requires registration: [http://www.adaptj.com/main/tracehowtos](http://www.adaptj.com/main/tracehowtos))

To use the command line:

1. Start Studio on the command line:

    1. On Windows: **Appcelerator****Studio.exe -consolelog,** **TitaniumStudio.exe -consolelog** or **AptanaStudio.exe -consolelog**

    2. On OS X: **/Applications/Appcelerator\\ Studio/AppceleratorStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/AppceleratorStudio,** **/Applications/Titanium\\ Studio/TitaniumStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/TitaniumStudio** or **/Applications/Aptana\\ Studio\\ 3/AptanaStudio3.app/Contents/MacOS/AptanaStudio3**

2. You may wish to adjust the buffer size of your console

    1. On Windows, right-click in the console window and choose **Properties**. Set the buffer size to 3000.

3. Enter the key sequence "<ctrl> + \\" in the console window.

4. Copy and paste the resulting output information into a document, and attach it to the JIRA ticket

If you have additional questions, you can see [http://wiki.eclipse.org/How\_to\_report\_a\_deadlock](http://wiki.eclipse.org/How_to_report_a_deadlock) for more information.

## JVM Terminated

When this happens, you'll see a rectangular dialog with a title of **JVM Terminate** on your screen and Studio will disappear. This indicates Java itself has crashed, but it creates a log file in the process.

By default, the crash file should be in either the Studio installation directory, or in the system temp directory, most likely with a file name of hs\_err\_pid\*.log. If you still could not locate it, follow the directions here:

* [Finding your Error Log](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/felog-138657.html#gbwcy)

* On OS X, the location is ~/Library/Logs/Java/\*.crash.log or ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter, and the file will have the word java in its name.

Please attach this log if you submit a support ticket.
