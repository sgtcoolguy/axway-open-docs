# Using Modules

Modules enable you extend Titanium's core functionality. Modules add support for device-specific hardware or operating system functionality. Modules also wrap native SDKs with Titanium-friendly JavaScript APIs to make them easier to implement within your apps. You can even create JavaScript modules for your Mobile Web projects to wrap RESTful APIs or to provide easy access to other functions.

In this chapter, you'll take at look at the sources for modules as well as how to implement a module within your project. This chapter doesn't cover how you'd write your own module; there's a separate chapter about that.

## Sections

**[Obtaining Modules](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Using_Modules/Obtaining_Modules/)**

First, we'll take a quick look at the various locations to which modules are commonly published. You'll also learn which modules are available to subscribers.

**[Using a Module](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Using_Modules/Using_a_Module/)**

In this section, you'll learn how to use a module within your app. We'll look at implementing a native module in both iOS and Android.
