Property

Description

## Example

### Perform a job and wait for results to return

Here we do something similar to the existing command, but instead, we perform the processing inside a job, and assign the results to a variable. We wait for the job to finish before returning.

`require` `'ruble'`

`command` `"Execute Selection/Line Inserting Results"`  `do` `|cmd|`

`cmd.key_binding =` `"CTRL+R"`

`cmd.output = :insert_as_text`

`cmd.input = [ :selection, :line ]`

`cmd.invoke` `do` `|context|`

`result =` `""`

`job = Ruble::Job.``new``(``"Running..."``) { result += IO.popen(STDIN.read,` `'r'``) {|io| io.read } }`

`job.schedule # start the job`

`job.join # wait` `for` `it to finish`

`return` `result`

`end`

`end`
