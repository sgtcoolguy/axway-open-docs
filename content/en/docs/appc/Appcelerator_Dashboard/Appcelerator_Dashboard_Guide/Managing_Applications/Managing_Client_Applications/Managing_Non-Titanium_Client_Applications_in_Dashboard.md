To use Appcelerator Platform Services in your Android and iOS applications, you need to first register an application in Appcelerator Dashboard. Registering the application defines the name, platform, and other metadata about the application. Once you've registered the application in Dashboard, you can download the libraries and frameworks to integrate Appcelerator Platform Services into your application. Appcelerator Dashboard also generates a new Mobile Backend Services datasource and the application keys required to enable the services in your app.

## Register an Application for Services

## Enable Platform Services

After you have created your client application, Dashboard directs you to the **Services** tab for the application. The **Services** tab displays the current status of the Cloud, Performance, and Analytics services. When the client application is first created, the Cloud, Performance, and Analytics services are automatically enabled. Follow the directions in the tab to add Platform Services to your application.

The **Services** tab also provides the functionality for you to generate a new security key. To generate a new security key:

1.  Use the **Environment** drop-down list to select the environment for which you want to generate the new key.
    
2.  Click **Generate a New Key**.
    
3.  Verify that you want to generate a new key for the selected environment. Click **Continue** to generate the new key. Click **Cancel** to return to the Services tab without generating a new key.
    

To integrate the Cloud and Analytics services with your application:

1.  Click the **Download** button to download the APS SDK, unpack it, and then add the library to your project.
    
2.  Copy the code snippets to your application as instructed to enable the services. Before copying and pasting the code snippet to enable or initialize services, use the **Environment** drop-down list to select the environment to which to deploy your application.
