## Overview

The following packages may be useful for advanced Titanium users, but are not necessary to develop with Titanium.

If you want to build the Titanium SDK from source, or to build native Android modules, you should read this section for software requirements.

Python is useful for users who want to build and run Titanium applications from the command line, users building native modules, or users building the Titanium SDK from source.

### Python (optional)

Python is required to compile the Titanium SDK from source using SCons.

Titanium supports the following versions of Python for each respective Operating System:

![download_05](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004836/download_05.png)

| Operating System | Package Version | Package Architecture Version | Download Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OS X | 2.x.x (currently, 2.7.x) | 32bit and 64bit | Installed on OS by default |
| Windows | 2.x.x (currently, 2.7.x) | 32bit **only** | [Official Python Website](http://www.python.org/download/) |
| Ubuntu | 2.x.x (currently, 2.7.x) | 32bit and 64bit | Default Repositories |

Download the installer from the applicable download location above.

See [Installing Python](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_Python/) for detailed instructions about how to install, including the program location and system environment variables that should be used.

### SCons (optional)

[SCons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCons) (Software Construction tool) is a build tool, similar to the classic make utility. It is used to build the [Titanium SDK](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile).

Installing scons is required if you want to build the Titanium SDK from source. It is not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

{{% alert title="⚠️ Warning" color="primary" %}}Python is a prerequisite for SCons, and should be installed first. See [Installing Python](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_Python/) for instructions.{{% /alert %}}

Obtain the SCons version listed below for your Operating System:

| Operating System | Package Version | Download Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS X | Latest Stable | [Official Website](http://scons.org/pages/download.html) |
| Windows | Latest Stable | [Official Website](http://scons.org/pages/download.html) |
| Ubuntu | Latest Stable | Default Repositories |

See [Installing SCons](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_SCons/) for detailed instructions about how to install, including the program location and system environment variables that should be used.

### Android Native Development Tools (NDK) (optional)

The Android NDK is required to build native Java/Kotlin modules for Android or to build the Titanium SDK from source.

The NDK is **not** required to build, run, or distribute apps using the Titanium SDK.

Titanium supports NDK Revision 11c and higher.

It's recommended to download the NDK via Android Studio. This will install it under the directory the Android SDK is installed at. Installing it via Android Studio avoids macOS Catalina (and newer versions) from requesting your permission to use the NDK tools when doing a build.

Alternatively, you can install the Android NDK to your own custom location by downloading from the following website:

![download_05](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004836/download_05.png)

[Download the Android NDK on developer.android.com](http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html)

See [Installing the Android NDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_the_Android_NDK/) for detailed instructions about how to install, including the program location and system environment variables that should be used.

### Ant (optional)

{{% alert title="❗️ Warning" color="danger" %}}Titanium 9.0.0 and newer versions no longer use Apache Ant. The below only applies to older SDK versions.{{% /alert %}}

Apache Ant is the standard build tool for Java. It can be used to build Titanium native Android modules and to build the Titanium SDK for Android. Ant is not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

{{% alert title="⚠️ Warning" color="primary" %}}Java is a prerequisite for Ant, and should be installed first. See [Installing Oracle JDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Oracle_JDK/) for instructions.{{% /alert %}}

Obtain the latest stable version of Apache Ant. Ant is supplied as a multi-platform archive. You can choose the archive format that's easiest for you to extract: all archives contain the same files.
