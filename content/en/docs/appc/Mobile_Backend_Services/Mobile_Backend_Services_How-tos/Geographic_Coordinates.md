# Geographic Coordinates

Mobile Backend Services lets you assign and query one or more custom geographic coordinates to predefined objects as well as custom objects. To assign custom geographic coordinates, see [Geographic Coordinates in Custom Fields](/docs/appc/Mobile_Backend_Services/Mobile_Backend_Services_Guide/Custom_Objects_and_Fields/) .

For information on querying geographic coordinates, see the [Search and Query](/docs/appc/Mobile_Backend_Services/Mobile_Backend_Services_Guide/Search_and_Query_APIs/) guide .
