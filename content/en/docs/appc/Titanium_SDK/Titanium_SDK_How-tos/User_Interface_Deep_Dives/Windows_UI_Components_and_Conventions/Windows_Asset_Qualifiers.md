Support for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone SDKs has been deprecated as of SDK 6.3.0.GA and has be removed in SDK 7.0.0.GA.

## Introduction

Windows Phone OS and Windows OS have a set of qualifiers you can use to select which assets to use based on screen size, language, region, theme, etc. The qualifiers can either be used as a name for a folder or may be included in the name of the file. If you use the qualifier as part of the filename, place the qualifier between the name and extension, for example, filename.qualifier.ext. You may combine qualifiers by concatenating them together with an underscore (\_). In your project, reference the files without the qualifiers.

Not all qualifiers are discussed in this topic, such as home region, direction layout, etc. For a complete list of qualifiers, refer to the [Windows Dev Center: How to name resources using qualifiers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh965324.aspx).

## Scale

Use the qualifiers below to support devices with different DPIs or screen resolutions. The scaling is based on the logical density factor returned by the device. The Windows Phone DPI column is an approximate value.

Qualifier

Logical Density Factor

Windows Phone DPI

Windows Store Resolution

Notes

1.0

Up to ~96

At least 1024x768

scale-140

1.4

Up to ~134 (WVGA emulator)

At least 1440x1080

scale-180

1.8

Contrast

Windows provides a high contrast theme as an accessibility feature. Use the following qualifiers to select an asset based on the high contrast theme:

## Language

For the language qualifiers, the notation differs if you place them in a folder or add the qualifier to the filename.

*   For folders, name the folder using the [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) standard and optionally with the country's [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=ISO_3166-1) Alpha-2 code, for example, place assets in either app/assets/windows/en-US or Resources/windows/en-US.
    
*   For the file name, add the lang- qualifier with the [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) standard and optionally with the country's [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=ISO_3166-1) Alpha-2 code, for example, name.lang-en-US.png.

## Example

A crazy technical writer decides to arrange the assets using the folders and filenames as shown below. Note that this example is to show the different ways to combine qualifiers. Do not structure your project this way.

`app`

`└── assets`

`└── windows`

`├── Image.lang-fr-CA_scale-``100``.png`

`├── Image.lang-fr-FR.png`

`├── Image.png`

`├── en-US`

`│ ├── scale-``100`

`│ │ └── Image.png`

`│ ├── scale-``140`

`│ │ └── Image.png`

`│ ├── scale-``180`

`│ │ └── Image.png`

`│ └── scale-``240`

`│ └── Image.png`

`└── en-US_contrast_high`

`└── Image.png`

Each image file can be referenced by just using the filename Image.png.

`// Reference the image without any of the qualifiers and the windows platform directory`

`imageView.image =` `'Image.png'``;`

The qualifiers tell Windows which image file to use.
