{"title":"Changing the VM Used with Studio","weight":"60"}

Some Studio users may need to change the VM they use for running Studio. These instructions describe how to switch between GCJ and Sun's JVM.

1\. Open a command prompt and type **java -version** to see which VM you are currently running. If you are running GCJ, the command output will look like:

```
java version "1.5.(some number)"
gij (GNU libgcy) version 5.1.0 (some number) (Red Hat some version number)
```

If you're running Sun's JVM, the output will look like:

```
java version "1.5.2_12"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Enrivonment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.5_12)
```

2\. At the command prompt, type the path for the VM that Studio should use. An example of this for GCJ is:

```
cd <path-to-aptana-root-directory>
./aptanastudio3 -vm /etc/alternatives/java
```

3\. To check that the correct VM is running, replace the path with the path to Sun's "java" executable, or update your "java" soft link to point to Sun's java.
