# Date Time Pickers

Demonstrates how to create a date/time picker using the Picker control.

Example App Source Location

You can find this example app in the Alloy repository under [samples/apps/ui/datetime\_picker](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/samples/apps/ui/datetime_picker). Check the [instructions](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/) how to run these sample projects.

The Picker control is used to let a user select one or more fixed values. You can set the type property of a Picker to display different types of information including [PICKER\_TYPE\_DATE\_AND\_TIME](#!/api/Titanium.UI-property-PICKER_TYPE_DATE_AND_TIME) and [PICKER\_TYPE\_DATE](#!/api/Titanium.UI-property-PICKER_TYPE_DATE). Set the type attribute to one of the date/time picker types. Then, supply the date in the XML or TSS as a string that can be parsed by the moment.js library.

The main index.xml view in the sample application sets the Picker element's type property to Ti.UI.PICKER\_TYPE\_DATE, and sets the minimum and maximum dates the control will display.

app/views/index.xml

`<``Alloy``>`

`<``Window``>`

`<!--`

`The text field is included to show that its value attribute`

`will not be parsed as a date, which is how the Picker's value`

`attribute will be treated.`

`-->`

`<``TextField`  `id``=``"txt"`  `value``=``"July 4, 2014"`  `top``=``"20"``/>`

`<``Picker`  `id``=``"picker"`  `top``=``"50"`

`type``=``"Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE"`

`minDate``=` `"2013-02-08 09:30:26 Z"`

`maxDate``=``"2015,11,17"``>`

`<!-- the value (selected date) is being set in the TSS -->`

`</``Picker``>`

`</``Window``>`

`</``Alloy``>`

The initial time displayed by the Picker control is set in the main view's TSS file. A Picker's value property can be any string that can parsed as a date by the [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/) library included with Alloy projects.

`'#index'``: {`

`backgroundColor:` `'#fff'``,`

`exitOnClose: true`

`"#picker"``: {`

`value:` `"December 17, 2013"`

`}`

`'#index[platform=android]'``: {`

`backgroundColor:` `'#000'`
