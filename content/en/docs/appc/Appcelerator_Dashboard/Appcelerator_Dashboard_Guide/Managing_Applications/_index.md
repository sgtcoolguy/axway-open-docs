{"title":"Managing Applications","weight":"40"}

To manage an application, select the application to manage from applications listed on the Dashboard home page **Apps** tab.

You can manage the following types of applications:

* [Client Applications](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Client_Applications/) – Titanium, Android or iOS application

* [Mobile Backend Services Datasources](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Mobile_Backend_Services_Datasources/) – Only standalone Mobile Backend Services (MBS) datasources (not created with a client application). For MBS datasources created with a client application, access the MBS datasource using the client application's API Builder tab.

* [API Builder Applications](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_API_Builder_Applications/)

* [Node.js Applications](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Applications/Managing_Node.js_Applications/)
