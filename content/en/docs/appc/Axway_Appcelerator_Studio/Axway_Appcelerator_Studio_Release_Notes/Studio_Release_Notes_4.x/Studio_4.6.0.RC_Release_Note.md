As of this release, Studio 4.5.x will not be supported six months from 4.6.0.GA's release date. See [Axway Appcelerator Deprecation Policy](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Deprecation_Policy/) and [Nominal Lifetimes](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Product_Lifecycle/#NominalLifetimes) documents for details.

## New Features

### App Preview

App Preview integration with iOS Adhoc and Android builds ([TISTUD-8009](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TISTUD-8009) and [TISTUD-8010](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TISTUD-8010)). App Preview is a new capability to distribute beta versions of your apps to testers and stakeholders. With this integration, Studio users can be able to upload an app to app preview.

### App Designer

App Designer is a powerful drag-and-drop UI design capability feature which now comes with the Appcelerator Studio as a default editor for Alloy Views. App Designer supports both designer and code editor.

App Designer is installed when Mac and Windows users install Appcelerator Studio 4.6.0 ([TISTUD-8457](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TISTUD-8457)). When the users upgrade Appcelerator Studio from previous versions to 4.6.0, App Designer is also installed.

For those of you who have App Designer installed on versions of Studio prior to 4.6.0, you will need to uninstall App Designer following these steps:

1. With **Appcelerator Studio** open, go to **Menu** > **About Appcelerator Studio**.

2. In the About Appcelerator Studio window, click on **Installation Details** button (found in the bottom left corner).

3. In the Appcelerator Studio Installation Details window, if the **Install Software** tab isn't selected, select it now.

4. Select **Appcelerator Designer** from the list.

5. Click **Uninstall** button from this window. This will take you to an "uninstall" page.

6. Click the **Finish** button. This process will take about 2-3 minutes. Once the uninstall is complete, Studio will show a window for **Software Updates** to restart it.

7. Click **Yes** to restart Studio.


## Improvements

* [TISTUD-8447](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TISTUD-8447) - Windows: Studio needs to specify the Windows SDK to be used when building to a Windows 10 emulator
