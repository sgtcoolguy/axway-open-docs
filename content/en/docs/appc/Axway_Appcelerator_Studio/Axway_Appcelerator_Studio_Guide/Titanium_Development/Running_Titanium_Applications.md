## Introduction

In Studio, Titanium applications may be executed in two modes:

*   In run mode, the program executes, but the execution may not be suspended or examined.
    
*   In debug mode, execution may be suspended and resumed, variables may be inspected, and expressions may be evaluated. For more information about debug mode, refer to [Debugging Titanium Applications](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Titanium_Development/Debugging_Titanium_Applications/).
    

To launch a project in run mode, first select the project in the **Project Explorer** view, then in the global tool bar, select **Run** from the **Launch Mode** drop-down list and a device from the **Target** drop-down list. If the **Launch Automatically** option is enabled under the **Target** drop-down list, the application will be automatically launched after the target is selected. If not, you need to click the **Launch** button to start the build process.

If you do not see your device or simulator listed in the **Target** drop-down list, select **Refresh Device** from the **Target** drop-down list.

Alternatively, you can select **Run Configurations** (the last device option) to change your run-time options for a specific application and override the default values set in **Preferences**.

## Run Configurations

Use **Run Configurations** to change your run-time options on the fly. You can create custom run configurations for each of your projects and save them as a different name.

In the **Project Explorer** view, first select your project, then from the global toolbar, select **Run** from the **Launch Mode** drop-down list and select the **Run Configuration...** option under the **Device** drop-down list  to launch the **Run Configurations** dialog. Select the deployment target you want to build and launch your application for, then configure your run-time options in the **Main** tab.

The following sections below list the run configurations for building your application on a specific emulator, simulator or device. Some common configuration settings include:

*   **Name**: name to call your run configuration. By default, Studio names them as: '\[Platform\] \[Deploy Target\] - \[Project Name\]'.
    
*   **Project**: select the project to be built and executed.
    
*   **Re-build Project on Launch**: if enabled, your code is rebuilt before being executed. This is an option for most emulators and simulators.
    
*   **Log Level**: select the verbosity level of the output log. This is an option for most emulators and simulators.
    
*   **Enable JavaScript Minification**: if enabled, your JavaScript code is minified (unnecessary white space is removed and code is obfuscated) before building. This is an option for most device builds (application installer).
    

### Android Application Installer

Configuration settings for building your application for Android devices:

*   **Android SDK Version**: select the Google API level to build your application against.
    

### Android Emulator

Configuration settings for building your application for the Android emulator:

*   **Android API**: select the Google API level to build your application against.
    
*   **Screen**: select the emulator skin, which varies by the Google API selected in the previous option. For a description of the options, refer to [http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html).
    

### iOS Application Installer

Configuration settings for building your application for an iOS device:

*   **Development Certificate**: select your iOS development certificate.
    
*   **Keychain**: select your Mac OS X keychain access file.
    
*   **Provisioning Profile**: select your iOS development provisioning profile.
    
*   **SDK Version**: select the iOS SDK version to build your application against.
    

If you have not obtained a development certificate or created a provisioning profile, refer to [Deploying to iOS devices](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Preparing_for_Distribution/Deploying_to_iOS_devices/).

You need to manually launch the application once it has been installed to the device.

### iOS Simulator

Configuration settings for building your application for an iOS simulator:

*   **Device**: select either **iPhone** or **iPad**.
    
*   **iOS SDK**: select the iOS SDK version to build your application against.
    
*   **Simulator Version**: select the simulator version to run your application on.
    
*   **Display Type**: select the simulator screen size: **Non-Retina**, **Retina** or **Retina & Tall**.
    

### Mobile Web Previewer on Emulator

Configuration settings for building your application to be previewed in a browser in an Android emulator:

*   **Android API**: select the Google API level to build your application against.
    
*   **Screen**: select the emulator skin, which varies by the Google API selected in the previous option. For a description of the options, refer to [http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html).
    
*   **Preview Server**: select the web server to deliver the application.
    

### Mobile Web Previewer

Configuration settings for building your application to be previewed in a desktop browser:

*   **Web Browser**: select the desktop browser to preview your application with.
    
*   **Preview Server**: select the web server to deliver the application.
    

## Troubleshooting

Try cleaning and rebuilding your project.

1.  From the menu, select **Project** > **Clean**.
    
2.  A dialog appears. Select the projects you want to clean and click the **OK** button.
    
3.  Build your project again. You can optionally enable the **Re-build Project on Launch** option with a **Run Configuration** for simulator and emulator builds.
    

### Android Emulator

#### Application Fails to Install Due to Insufficient Memory

1.  Open the AVD configuration file with your favorite text editor. The following are the default locations:
    
    1.  On Mac OS X systems, open ~/.android/avd/<AVD\_name>.avd/config.ini.
        
    2.  On Windows 7 and 8 systems, open C:\\Users\\<user>\\.android\\avd\\<AVD\_name>.avd\\config.ini.
        
2.  Add or edit the following variable:
    

`disk.dataPartition.size=<size_in_MB>m`

### iOS Simulator

#### Reserved Folder Names

Double-check that your project does not contain the following directories, which are reserved for Xcode projects:

*   Resources/Resources
    
*   Resources/Frameworks
    

#### Reset the Simulator

If all else fails, you can reset your simulator, which erases all data, settings and applications from your simulator. To reset your simulator:

1.  Launch your simulator or start Xcode then select **Open Developer Tool** > **iOS Simulator** to start the simulator.
    
2.  Select **iOS Simulator** > **Reset Content and Settings**.
    
3.  A dialog appears asking to confirm your decision. Click the **Reset** button.
