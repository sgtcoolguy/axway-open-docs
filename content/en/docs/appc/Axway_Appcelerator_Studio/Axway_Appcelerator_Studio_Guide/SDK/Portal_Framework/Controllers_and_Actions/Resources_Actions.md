## Requirements

The examples in this page use the _**Prototype**_ library, which is included by default inside a portal. However, the same concepts may be applied using other implementations.

## Description

These set of actions can retrieve various resources information from the Studio. At the moment it's pretty limited to listing projects, but more will be added in time.

## Invocation

This command is executed immediately in a synchronous way.

## Get all accessible project names

The following _dispatch_ call will get a names array of all the accessible (open and existing) project names:

`var allProjects = dispatch($H({`

`controller:` `'portal.resources'``,`

`action:` `"getProjects"`

`}).toJSON()).evalJSON();`

The returned value is an array of strings (names).
