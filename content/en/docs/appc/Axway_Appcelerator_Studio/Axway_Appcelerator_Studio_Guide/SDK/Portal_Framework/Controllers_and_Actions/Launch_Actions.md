## Requirements

The examples in this page use the _**Prototype**_ library, which is included by default inside a portal. However, the same concepts may be applied using other implementations.

## Description

These set of actions can:

1.  Retrieve information from the Studio regarding the available launch shortcuts (types).
    
2.  Invoke an available launch on a specific project and mode.
    

## Invocation

This command is executed immediately in a synchronous way for the retrieval of the launch information, and execute asynchronously for the launch itself.

## Get launch types

The following _dispatch_ call will get a _Map_ of all the available launch type IDs for a given project name and launch mode:

`var launchTypes = dispatch($H({`

`controller:` `'portal.launch'``,`

`action:` `"getLaunchTypes"``,`

`args: {`

`"project"``:` `"MyProject"``,`

`"mode"``:` `"run"`

`}`

`}).toJSON()).evalJSON();`

**Conditions:**

1.  The project must be accessible for a successful retrieval of the mapping.
    
2.  The mode can _only_ be one of: _'run', 'debug' or 'profile'_
    

The returned value is a _Map_ between launch type IDs and their descriptive name.  
That way, it's possible to render the same string the Studio display when a user right click a project and select _'Run As -> ...'_.  
The returned type ID should later be used with the _**launch**_ command-action.

## Launching a project

The following _dispatch_ call will launch a specified project.

`var result = dispatch($H({`

`controller:` `'portal.launch'``,`

`action:` `"launch"``,`

`args: {`

`"project"``:` `"MyProject"``,`

`"mode"``:` `"run"``,`

`"type"``:` `"com.aptana.launch.type.id"`

`}`

`}).toJSON());`

**Conditions:**

1.  The project must be accessible for a successful retrieval of the mapping.
    
2.  The mode can _only_ be one of: _'run', 'debug' or 'profile'_
    
3.  The _type_ must be one that match a type that is returned with the _getLaunchTypes_ call.
    

The _result_ field indicate "OK" or "ERROR". In case of an "OK", a launch will start in a Job.

## Sample of use

An extensive example exists at the _**[studio3-sdk](https://github.com/aptana/studio3-sdk)**_ repository (_launch.js_)
