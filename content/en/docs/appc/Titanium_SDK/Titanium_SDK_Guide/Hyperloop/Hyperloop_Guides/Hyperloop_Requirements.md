## Requirements

Youâ€™ll need to have the following installed on your machine as the recommended requirements to use Hyperloop 3.0.0+:

*   Appcelerator Studio: 5.0.0+
    
*   Titanium SDK: 7.0.0+
    
*   Appcelerator CLI: 7.0.0+
    
*   Android 4.0.0+ (for Android development)
    

You can install [Appcelerator Studio](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio) and [Appcelerator CLI](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/cli) to get the latest version of all these components.

### Optional Dependencies

These dependencies are used only if you plan to integrate hyperloop with them. You **do not** need Alloy or Cocoapods to use Hyperloop, but may use Hyperloop in an Alloy app - or consume 3rd-party libraries on iOS using Cocoapods.

*   Alloy 1.8.0+
    
*   [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) 1.0.0+ (see note)
    

Note: If you plan on using CocoaPods as a third-party dependencies manager, you will need to have (at a minimum) CocoaPods 1.0.0 or later installed. See [Using third-party libraries with CocoaPods](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/Hyperloop_Guides/iOS_Hyperloop_Programming_Guide/#CocoaPods) for details on how to install and set up your project.

## Installation

### Appcelerator Studio

To download and install Appcelerator Studio:

1.  Log in to [https://platform.axway.com/](https://platform.axway.com/).
    
2.  Expand the Appcelerator menu ![appc_menu](/Images/appc/download/thumbnails/30083017/appc_menu.png) and click on [App Builder](https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio) link.
    
3.  Click on the installer for your OS. Wait a moment while the installer downloads.
    
4.  Launch the downloaded installer and follow the steps to install. If the installer asks to install a specific version of Java, allow it. See [Titanium Compatibility Matrix#JavaDevelopmentKit](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix/#JavaDevelopmentKit) for details on which versions we support.
