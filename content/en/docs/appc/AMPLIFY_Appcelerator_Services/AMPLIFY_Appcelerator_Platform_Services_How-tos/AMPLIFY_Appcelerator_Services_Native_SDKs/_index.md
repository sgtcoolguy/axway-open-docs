For native Android applications built with Java, see the [Quick Start Guide for Android APS SDK](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_Android/Quick_Start_Guide_for_Android_APS_SDK/).

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [Quick Start Guide for iOS APS SDK](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/Quick_Start_Guide_for_iOS_APS_SDK/).

For native iOS applications built with Swift, see the [Quick Start Guide for iOS APS SDK using Swift](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/Quick_Start_Guide_for_iOS_APS_SDK_using_Swift/).

### Appcelerator Analytics

Appcelerator Analytics collects and presents information in real-time about your application's user acquisition, engagement, and usage. Use the APSAnalytics API to send custom analytic events for navigation, geolocation, and feature events.

See the following topics for Appcelerator Analytics Service:

For native Android applications built with Java, see the [APS Analytics for Android guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_Android/APS_Analytics_for_Android/) and [APSAnalytics Android API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/android/com/appcelerator/aps/APSAnalytics.html).

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [APS Analytics for iOS guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/APS_Analytics_for_iOS/) and [APSAnalytics iOS API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/ios/Classes/APSAnalytics.html).

### Appcelerator Cloud

Appcelerator Cloud provides an interface to Mobile Backend Services, which includes access to pre-defined REST objects and push notification services, respectively. Your application uses the APSCloud class and supporting cloud object classes to access Mobile Backend Services with Java or Objective-C calls.

See the following topics for Appcelerator Cloud Service:

For native Android applications built with Java, see the [APS Cloud for Android guide](/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/android) and [APSCloud Android API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/android/com/appcelerator/aps/APSCloud.html).

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [APS Cloud for iOS guide](/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/ios) and [APSCloud iOS API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/ios/Classes/APSCloud.html).

### Dashboard

Once you have your application set up to use Appcelerator Services, use Dashboard to monitor your application and view metrics about it. Dashboard lets you view and diagnose your mobile application's health and usage statistics. The Dashboard provides a lot of technical data about your application.
