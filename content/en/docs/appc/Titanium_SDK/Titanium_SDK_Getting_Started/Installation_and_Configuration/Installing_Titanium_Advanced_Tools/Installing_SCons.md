## Compatibility and Download

[SCons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCons) (Software Construction tool) is a build tool, similar to the classic make utility. It is used to build the [Titanium SDK](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile).

Installing scons is required if you want to build the Titanium SDK from source. It is not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

Python is a prerequisite for SCons, and should be installed first. See [Installing Python](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_Python/) for instructions.

Obtain the SCons version listed below for your Operating System:
