## Cannot update from Studio 5.0.0 to Studio 5.1.0

*   With Appcelerator Studio 5.1.0 release, we have upgraded the Eclipse core from 4.4 to 4.7. This update brings a different directory structure to Studio for MacOS users.
    
*   Due to several internal changes, it is not possible to update from Studio 5.0.0 to 5.1.0. Users are advised to download and install a fresh copy of Studio 5.1.0 installer directly for both Windows and MacOS. Please review [Uninstalling Studio](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Updating_Studio/Uninstalling_Studio/) for removing Studio (as necessary for your setup).
    
*   You are advised to use the existing workspace directory when launching Studio 5.1.0 to get your old studio projects
    

## Noteworthy changes

*   Added support for Java 9 and 10
    
*   Upgraded Eclipse from 4.4 to 4.7
    
*   Upgraded GIT to 2.16.2
    
*   Added Windows 64-bit Studio builds (which requires 64-bit Java installers)
    
*   Studio installs Java 1.8.162 if there are not supported Java versions installed (by default)
    
*   Updated JRuby and Ruby to versions 9.1.16 and 2.5 respectively to be compatible with Java 9 (useful for loading templates like HTML, JSON, Ruby, and so)
    

## Installers

### For MacOS

![studio_5.0_and_5.1](/Images/appc/download/attachments/56296323/studio_5.0_and_5.1.png)

The Studio 5.1.0 installer creates **AppceleratorStudio** application launcher package under /Applications directory. Previously, it used to be under Appcelerator Studio directory.

To launch the studio 5.1.0, double click on the **AppceleratorStudio** package launcher file.

To view the contents of “AppceleratorStudio” file,

1.  Right-click on **AppceleratorStudio**.
    
2.  Select **Show Package Contents**.
    

#### Studio configuration file

Studio configuration file (AppceleratorStudio.ini) is now located in /Applications/AppceleratorStudio.app/Contents/Eclipse/AppceleratorStudio.ini.

### Windows

The 64-bit Windows OS Studio 5.1.0 RC builds are not updated in the [Appcelerator Studio preview](http://preview.appcelerator.com/appc-studio/) page. You can download it directly from [https://s3.amazonaws.com/titanium-studio/5.1.0/Appcelerator\_Studio-x64.exe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/titanium-studio/5.1.0/Appcelerator_Studio-x64.exe).

The installer uses the same location as previous versions of Studio. There is no change in the folder structure for Windows.

By default, Studio is installed to %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Appcelerator\\Appcelerator Studio\\ folder.

With Studio 5.1.0, we introduce support for 64-bit Studio builds so that we can leverage the features of [Java 9](https://www.oracle.com/java/java9.html).
