{"title":"Titanium SDK","weight":"90"}

The Titanium SDK helps you to build native cross-platform mobile application using JavaScript and the Titanium API, which abstracts the native APIs of the mobile platforms. Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications, featuring over 80% code reuse across mobile apps. Axway licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use.
