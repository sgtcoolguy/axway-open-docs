## Improvements

CLI 5.2.1 now supports the creation of test applications without the need to create a classic project ([CLI-687](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/CLI-687)). You can now use the \--testapp flag with appc new to do the same thing in one step. Previously, you had to run the following steps:

`appc` `new` `-t titanium --classic -i com.appc.picker -n AlloyPicker`

`cd AlloyPicker`

`appc alloy` `new` `--testapp ui/picker`

With this version, you can use this one command:

`appc` `new` `-t titanium -i com.appc.picker -n AlloyPicker --testapp ui/picker`
