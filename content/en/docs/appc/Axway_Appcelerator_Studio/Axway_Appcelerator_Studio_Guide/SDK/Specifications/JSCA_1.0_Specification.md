## Overview

This is a brief description of the JSCA file format. This JSON-based format is used to define content assist metadata for the Javascript Content Assist (CA) system. The structure of JSCA is described by another JSON-based format called [JFF](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/SDK/Specifications/JFF_1.0_Specification/) (JSON File Format).

Please note, that in general, properties on a JSON object may occur in any order; however, in order to simplify processing of JSCA files, it is required that any JSON objects having a "name" property must list that property before all others.

## Short Example

```javascript
{
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "Titanium.Android.NotificationManager",
      "examples": [],
      "functions": [

## Top-Level Properties

The JSCA file format consists of a single top-level object with the following properties: version, build, aliases, and types. Below is a description of each of these properties

```
{
  "version": "http://url-to-version-spec",
  "aliases": [],
  "types": []
}
```

### Version Property

The version property indicates the file format version number of the JSCA file. The current version number is 1.0. It is expected that this value will change as new JSCA structures are defined.

```
"version": "1.0"
```

### Build Property

The build property indicates the current build of the file

```
"build": "1.7.0-201103300900"
```

### Aliases Property

The aliases property allows for the definition of shortcuts to deeply nested types. This property consists of an array of Alias types. This property is optional.

```
"aliases": [
    {
      "type": "Titanium",
      "name": "Ti"
    }
  ]
```

### Types Property

This is perhaps the most important top-level property. This property contains a list of Type types used to defined the types in the JSCA file. This property is optional.

```
{
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "Titanium.Android.NotificationManager",
      "examples": [],
      "functions": [],
      "events": [],
      "userAgents": [],
      "remarks": [],
      "deprecated": false,
      "since": [],
      "properties": [],
      "description": "<p>Module to notify users of events that happen.</p>"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Types

Below is a list of types declared in the JSCA JFF file. These types are what are used to describe the JS types contained within a JSCA file.
