{"title":"Working with Local Data Sources","weight":"70"}

Even the most rudimentary applications usually have some data storage requirements. Perhaps you want to save a user's name or preferences. Your app could download product information so that it's available when the network is not available. Or, maybe users snap photos which you save as files for later use within your application. In any of these cases, storing data on the user's device is a critical feature. In this chapter, you'll explore Titanium's uniform, cross-platform methods for accessing local data stores.

## Sections in this chapter

**[Choosing a Persistence Strategy for your Application](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Local_Data_Sources/Choosing_a_Persistence_Strategy_for_Your_Application/)**

In this chapter, you'll examine the various ways you can store data locally on the user's device and decide when it's best to use each technique.

**[Lightweight Persistence with the Properties API](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Local_Data_Sources/Lightweight_Persistence_with_the_Properties_API/)**

Next, you'll learn how to store both simple and complex data in app properties and retrieve that data later.

**[Working with a SQLite Database](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Local_Data_Sources/Working_with_a_SQLite_Database/)**

In this chapter, you will learn how to interact with the built-in SQLite3 RDMS with the Titanium.Database module.

**[Filesystem Access and Storage](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Local_Data_Sources/Filesystem_Access_and_Storage/)**

Finally, you'll learn how to manipulate files and directories by using the Titanium.Filesystem module.
