{"title":"Cross-Platform Mobile Development In Titanium","weight":"10"}

Titanium does much more than just build apps that run on multiple platforms. Its true power comes from how it helps you build _best of breed_, _native_ apps that take full advantage of the platforms on which they run. By this, we mean apps that:

* Use hardware-specific features, such as the Android menu button

* Use OS-specific controls, such as the Cocoa UI controls on iOS

* Participate in the platform ecosystem, for example using platform-appropriate notification mechanisms


Your Titanium apps should do more than just run on iOS and Android. When running on an iOS device, your app should _feel_ like an iOS app. Your Android app should _feel_ like an Android app.

In this chapter, we'll take a look at strategies for writing best-of-breed apps. You'll learn a variety of techniques for creating scalable, performant cross platform mobile projects. Finally, you'll learn how to increase the accessibility of your apps with internationalization.

## Sections in this chapter

**[Android Platform Overview](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Cross-Platform_Mobile_Development_In_Titanium/Android_Platform_Overview/)**

You'll take a look at what goes into an Android app, including user interface specifics and behind-the-scenes underpinnings.
