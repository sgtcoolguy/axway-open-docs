To verify your phone number:

1.  Complete the **Phone Number** field. The phone number should be entered as digits only.
    
2.  Click the **Verify** button. When the **Verify** button is clicked, Dashboard sends a phone verification code to the phone number entered in the **Phone Number** field, and the **Verification Code** field is displayed. If you do not receive a verification code, click **Resend**.

    Once a valid verification code is entered, Dashboard will process the verification and update the verification status of the phone number.
