# 26 September 2013

This update includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:

*   The query methods support two new parameters: sel and unsel. Use these parameters to specify which fields to return or not to return. You cannot use these parameters together.
    
*   Website: Added new feature to unsubscribe devices from push notifications using the ACS web console.
    
*   Fixed an issue where the $inc operation was not auto-incrementing a custom field.
