{"title":"Welcome To Titanium!","weight":"10"} 

Titanium's unique trait among the various available cross-platform mobile solutions is that it creates truly native apps. This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components & services, as well as near-native performance, features you won't find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you'll have access to other features like:

*   Platform specific APIs
    
*   Location-based services
    
*   Social sharing
    
*   Rich multimedia
    
*   Online and on-device data
    
*   Extensibility
    
*   and much more!
