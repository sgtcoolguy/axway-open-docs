This page gives an overview of the Tasks View.

## Introduction

The Tasks View provides a "to-do" list for you of tasks for the projects in your workspace. These tasks are not automated or connected to anything; a task list simply helps you track what you need to get done.

## Opening the view

*   From the _Window_ menu, select _Show View > Tasks_.
    
*   To close the _Tasks View_, click the Close button (**X**) in the upper right of the tab.
    

Studio will display the **Tasks View** as a tab at the bottom of your screen, as shown in the image below.

## Editing the Task keywords

Define your tags that will add a task to the task list in **Preferences... > Studio > Tasks**.

The keywords **TODO**, **FIXME** and **XXX** are defined as task tags by default.

## Adding a task manually

1.  Right-click in the left margin of your editor and select **Add Task...** from the context menu.
    
2.  On the **Add Task** pop-up window, add the information for your task.
    
    1.  In the **Description** text box, type a short description for the task.
        
    2.  From the **Priority** drop-down list, select whether the task is Low, Normal, or High priority.
        
3.  Click the **OK** button.
    

Studio adds your new task to the Task View. When you complete the task, you can check the associated check box to mark it off the list.
