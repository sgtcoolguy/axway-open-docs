The ACS service was updated today with a number of bug fixes and improvements. Highlights include:

*   Updated API usage reporting to report the number of pushes.
    
*   On the ACS website, added the ability to add a record to an existing custom object without requiring the user to duplicate and recreate the object.
    
*   Fixed an issue where HTML tags were stripped from custom object fields when editing the fields in the ACS website.
    
*   When exporting data from the website, the mechanism for selecting date ranges is improved, and invalid date ranges are rejected.
    
*   Fixed an issue that prevented users from unsubscribing from push notifications when multiple users subscribe to push notifications from the same device.
    
*   A number of fixes to the ACS web administration console.
    
*   An update was made to the ACS Android SDK.
