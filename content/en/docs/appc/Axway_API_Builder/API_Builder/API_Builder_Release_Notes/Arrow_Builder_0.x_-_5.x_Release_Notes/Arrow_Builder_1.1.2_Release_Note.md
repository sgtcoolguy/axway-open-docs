## Arrow Builder 1.1.2 - 20 July 2015

Arrow Builder 1.1.2 is a patch release, addressing high-priority issues from previous releases.

### Fixed Issues

* API-914: After block runs on generated models before API finishes

* API-917: The styling of the code examples in the Admin console is skewed for both local builds and published Arrow applications.

* API-920: If you make a DELETE or PUT request, then "TypeError: object is not a function" error is returned back
