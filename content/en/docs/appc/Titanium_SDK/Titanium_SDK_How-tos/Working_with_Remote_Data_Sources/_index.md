# Working with Remote Data Sources

In this module, you'll explore how you can interact with remote network resources from your Titanium Mobile app. Accessing the network will enable you to interact with web APIs, social networks, and data back-ends.

## Sections in this chapter

**[HTTPClient and the Request Lifecycle](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/HTTPClient_and_the_Request_Lifecycle/)**

Titanium implements the XML HTTP Request (XHR) model and in this chapter you'll explore how XHR network requests are serviced.

**[Working with JSON Data](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/Working_with_JSON_Data/)**

In this chapter, you'll explore how you can interact with JSON data returned from a network call.

**[Working with XML Data](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/Working_with_XML_Data/)**

Then in this chapter, you'll explore the ways you can work with XML data you retrieve from the network.

**[Dealing with SOAP Web Services](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/Dealing_with_SOAP_Web_Services/)**

SOAP services are popular with corporate portals and services, but SOAP presents some challenges to mobile access. In this chapter, you'll explore some strategies for working with SOAP data.

**[File Uploads and Downloads](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/File_Uploads_and_Downloads/)**

In this section, you'll explore how you can upload and download files in your Titanium apps.

**[Integrate with Mobile Backend Services](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/Integrate_with_Mobile_Backend_Services/)**

Finally, in this section learn how to integrate with ArrowDB (formerly Appcelerator Cloud Services) and use this powerful API set in your mobile apps.

So let's get started: [HTTPClient and Request Lifecycle >](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Working_with_Remote_Data_Sources/HTTPClient_and_the_Request_Lifecycle/)
