## Overview

Debugging is a bit of a misnomer, as currently you can only really set trace output. Proper debugging is currently on the TODO list, but not yet available.

## Writing to the console

You can write directly to the Scripting Console by using CONSOLE.puts, i.e.:

`CONSOLE.puts` `"Hello!"`

## Set the the logging level

You can set the logging level in script:

`Ruble::Logger.log_level = :trace`

Logging levels are:

*   none
    
*   trace
    
*   info
    
*   warning
    
*   error
    

You might add this at the top of your file. With broader logging levels containing all the content from more restrictive ones (i.e. trace contains info, warning and error as well).

Output will be put to the Scripting Console, and is theme-able as per the regular theme guidelines for "console" scopes.

The logging level will persist at the newly set level until it is explicitly changed again.

## Logging to the console

A example of turning on logging, and writing out trace, info, warning, and error messages.

`require` `'ruble'`

`require` `'ruble/ui'`

`Ruble::Logger.log_level = :trace`

`command` `'Tidy'`  `do` `|cmd|`

`cmd.output = :replace_document`

`cmd.input = :document`

`cmd.invoke` `do` `|context|`

`Ruble::Logger.trace` `"trace"`

`Ruble::Logger.log_info` `"Info"`

`Ruble::Logger.log_warning` `"Warning"`

`Ruble::Logger.log_error` `"Error"`

`end`

`end`

## Writing out properties

It's sometimes helpful to write out the properties of the current context object. An example of doing so:

`command` `"Print Context Properties"`  `do` `|cmd|`

`cmd.invoke` `do` `|context|`

`context.dynamic_properties.each { |k| CONSOLE.puts` `"#{k}\n"` `}`

`end`

`end`

prints:

`project`

`editor`

`input_type`

`browser`

`command`

`bundle`

`TM_SELECTED_FILES`

`1316024714117_env`

`test_property`

`invoked_via`

## Writing out available methods

It's also sometimes useful to write out the methods available on a particular object, i.e.:

`command` `"Print Document Methods"`  `do` `|cmd|`

`cmd.invoke` `do` `|context|`

`CONSOLE.puts context.editor.document.public_methods(``true``).sort`

`end`

`end`

## Disabling caching

In order to speed up bundle loading, we cache the overall structure of the bundle. This can cause problems on some versions of Windows, where a user might not see any changes until they restart Studio. To disable caching, please follow the instructions [here](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Customizing_Studio/Rubles/Disable_Ruble_Caching/).
