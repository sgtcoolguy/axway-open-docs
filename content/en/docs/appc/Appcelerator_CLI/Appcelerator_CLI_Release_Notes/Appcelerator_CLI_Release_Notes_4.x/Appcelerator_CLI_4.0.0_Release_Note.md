## Known Issues

### ETIMEDOUT is returned when you publish an Arrow app

Occasionally, when publishing an Arrow application, the CLI may return an ETIMEOUT error ([CLI-654](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/CLI-654)).

To workaround this issue, try republishing the application again.

### Fail to Encrypt JavaScript Files on Windows

When building an application on Windows, the build fails at the encryption stage ([CLI-658](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/CLI-658)).

To workaround this issue, install the 32-bit version of Java.
