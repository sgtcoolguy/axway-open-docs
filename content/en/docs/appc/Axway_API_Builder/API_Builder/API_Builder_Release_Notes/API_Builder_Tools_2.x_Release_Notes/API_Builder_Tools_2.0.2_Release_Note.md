As of this release, the previous API Builder Tools patch release is no longer supported. Note: Major and minor releases continue to be supported according to their nominal lifetime. See [Axway Appcelerator Deprecation Policy](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Deprecation_Policy/) and [Nominal Lifetimes](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Product_Lifecycle/#nominal-lifetimes) documents for details.

## New features

* APIs defined as Swagger Endpoints can now be tested similarly to the APIs generated from models

* Individual API Endpoints defined in a Swagger defined API can now be deleted on the API Details view

## Fixed issues

    * The Swagger API generated by API Builder Tools 2.0.0 did not include the inline schema defined for the parameters

* Generated Swagger Spec for model-first APIs now correctly reflects the response schemas

    * Array type information is maintained for composite models

    * Models are now included for manually defined APIs

* Other minor bug fixes and improvements
