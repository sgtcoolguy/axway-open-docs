# Arrow Cloud 1.5.0 - 23 February 2016

This release of Arrow Cloud includes version 1.2.0 of the CLI and 1.5.0 of the server and includes a new feature and improvement and one bug fix.

## New Feature and Improvements

*   With the 1.5.0 release, we introduce a new feature called in-place upgrade that allows for a faster app upgrade (as compared to the default zero-downtime upgrade). With the in-place upgrade, you can expect a small downtime. See [In-place App Upgrading](/docs/appc/Axway_API_Builder/AMPLIFY_Runtime_Services/AMPLIFY_Runtime_Services_How-tos/In-place_App_Upgrading/) for more details.
