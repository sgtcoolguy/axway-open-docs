{"title":"Debugging iOS Apps with 3rd-party Tools","weight":"10"}

You can debug your Titanium App using the Safari DevTools. No matter the route you take, you must ensure that your project is using the built-in JavaScriptCore framework. For projects running Titanium SDK 7.0.0 and later, this option is enabled by default. For older projects, it can be enabled as seen below.

Searching for Android Debugging? [Here](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Titanium_Development/Debugging_Titanium_Applications/Debugging_on_Android_Devices/Debugging_Android_Apps_with_3rd-party_Tools/) you go!

## Enable use-jscore-framework

With Titanium SDK 6.x, developers must add a tag to enable the iOS debugger in order to use Safari (or iOS-webkit-debug-proxy). With SDK 7.x and later, this value is assumed to be true unless you explicitly add the tag with false as the value.

The key is to enable the use-jscore-framework option in tiapp.xml:

```xml
<tiapp>
    ...
    <ios>
        ...
        <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>
        ...
    </ios>
    ...
</tiapp>
```

Once enabled, this will force the SDK to use the pre-packaged JSCore framework/engine as the JavaScript engine internally (rather than our older TiCore framework).

Since iOS 7, the pre-packaged JScore framework has contained a debugging agent and protocol using webinspectord. We make use of this service/protocol with our newest iOS debugger in SDK 6.0.0 as does Safari in it's tooling.

## Debugging with Safari DevTools

Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as listed in [Enable use-jscore-framework](#enable-use-jscore-framework).

1. Launch the app on the device or a simulator.

    If using a device, make its connected by an USB cable before debugging.

    1. Launch you application via Studio or command-line: appc run -p ios

2. Launch Safari and enable the **Develop** mode (**Safari** > **Preferences** > **Advanced** and enable **Show Develop menu in menu bar**).

    It is important to have the Web Inspector enabled to allow connections for debugging. Otherwise, neither Studio nor Safari's debugger will be able to connect to the device using the web-inspector based protocol.

3. Once the app is up and running, connecting to the debugger depends on whether you are using a simulator or device.

    1. Simulator: **Safari** > **Developer** > **Simulator** > **JSContext**

    2. Device: **Safari** > **Developer** > **<device name>** > **JSContext**

### Safari Breakpoints

Sometimes you cannot connect the debugger to the app until it's already executed the code its likely to break at. Try this workaround:

1. Launch the simulator.

2. Open **Safari** > **Develop** > **Simulator**.

3. Ensure **Automatically Show Web Inspector for JSContexts** and **Automatically Pause Connecting to JSContexts** are both enabled.

4. Launch the app/build via **Studio** or the **CLI**. You should be able to connect and control the debugger before the app fully launches.
