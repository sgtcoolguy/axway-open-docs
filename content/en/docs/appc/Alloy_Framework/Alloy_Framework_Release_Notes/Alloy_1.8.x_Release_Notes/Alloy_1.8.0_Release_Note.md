## Improvements

* [ALOY-1365](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/ALOY-1365) - Improve how Alloy works with i18n and platform folders

  * Alloy has improved i18n and platform-specific resources support. You can now add i18n and platform directories in your /app directory and in your active theme's directory. Additionally, widgets may also have an i18n directory.

  * When you build your app, Alloy will delete the /i18n and /platform/<platform> directories in the project's root directory. Next it will copy and merge the i18n and platform/<platform> directories from the Alloy app's directory into the project's root directory. For platform-specific files, it starts by copying all files from /app/platform/<platform>, then overrides with files from /app/themes/<theme name>/platform/<platform>. i18n files are copied from the /app/i18n and /app/themes/<theme name>/i18n directories followed by the each widget's /app/widgets/<widget name>/i18n directory.

  * It's important to reiterate that the /i18n, /platform/<platform>, and /Resources directories are regenerated each time you build. Any manual change to files in these directories will be lost during the next build.

  * When creating a new Alloy project, it will automatically move existing /i18n and /platform directories into the /app directory. Existing Alloy apps that already have /i18n or /platform directories in the project's root directory will fail to build until these directories into the /app directory.

* [ALOY-86](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/ALOY-86) - Add support for distributing widgets via NPM
