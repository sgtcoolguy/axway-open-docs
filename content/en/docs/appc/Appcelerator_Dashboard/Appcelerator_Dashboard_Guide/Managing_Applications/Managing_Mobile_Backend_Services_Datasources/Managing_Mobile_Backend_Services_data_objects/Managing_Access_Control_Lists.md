# Managing Access Control Lists

Access control lists let you control read and write access to Mobile Backend Services (MBS) objects. Read permission includes the ability to show, query, and search MBS objects. Write permission includes the ability to update and delete MBS objects. An Access Control List (ACL) consists of the following:

*   A public read flag granting read permission to all users, **or** a list of users granted read permission
    
*   A public write flag granting write permission to all users, **or** a list of users granted write permission
    

An object's owner always has read and write permission.

## Creating an ACL

To create an ACL:

1.  On the main Manage Data screen, click **Access Control**.
    
2.  Click **\+ Access List** to open the ACL creation form.
    
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the ACL.
    
4.  In the **Creator** field, click the **+** icon and select the object's owner from the list of application Users.
    
    The object's owner always has read and write permission.
