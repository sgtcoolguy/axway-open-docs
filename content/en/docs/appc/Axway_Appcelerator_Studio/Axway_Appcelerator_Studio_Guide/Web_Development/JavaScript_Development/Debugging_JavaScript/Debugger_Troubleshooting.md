You got here because of an issue with the Studio debugger. Here is some information that should help you identify a cause and find possible solutions.

## Firefox Users

The AptanaDebugger extension is available at [https://github.com/aptana/studio3/blob/development/bundles/com.aptana.js.debug.core/res/firefox/aptanadebugger.xpi](https://github.com/aptana/studio3/blob/development/bundles/com.aptana.js.debug.core/res/firefox/aptanadebugger.xpi).

It is compatible with Firefox 3+ and Firebug 1.7+

1. If, for some reason, your Debugger Plugin for Firefox did not work by default, download the above file.

2. Then drag and drop that file on top of your Firefox.

3. Complete installation and relaunch the debugger.

## Internet Explorer (IE) Users

Go to [Installing the Internet Explorer debugger](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Web_Development/JavaScript_Development/Debugging_JavaScript/Installing_the_Internet_Explorer_debugger/).
