## Overview

This document lists the minimum requirements necessary to run a Titanium environment.

### Memory

The minimum memory requirement for Studio and the Titanium SDK is as follows:

| Product | Host Operating System | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Appcelerator Studio | All | 1 GB (contiguous) |
| Latest Android SDK | macOS | 1.5 GB (contiguous) |
| Latest Android SDK | Windows | 1 GB (contiguous) |

Minimum system memory requirements is 8GB of RAM. 16GB is highly recommended.

### Operating System

Titanium is supported on the following Operating Systems:

| Operating System | Version |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | 10.11.5 (Mavericks) and later |
| Windows | Windows 7 and later(Android)  <br />Windows 8.1 and later (Windows Phone)  <br />Windows 10 and later (Windows 10 Mobile) |

As of Titanium 9.0.0, building Windows apps is no longer supported.

Support for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone SDKs has been deprecated as of SDK 6.3.0.GA and has be removed in SDK 7.0.0.GA.

### Required Software

The Titanium SDK requires Oracle's JDK and Node.js.

If you are using Studio for Mac OS X and Windows, Studio prompts you to install the required software.

#### Java Development Kit

Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to be installed in order to work with Titanium.

Be aware that no other flavors of JDK, such as OpenJDK, currently work with Titanium; only Oracle's will suffice.

Titanium supports the following versions of JDK for each respective Operating System:

| Operating System | Min JDK Version | Max JDK Version | Package Arch Version | Download Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OS X | 8 | 8 latest revision | 64-bit | [Official Website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) | * On Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier, the JDK is preinstalled.<br />    <br />* On Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later, the OS should prompt you to install it when needed.<br />    <br />* Android Development on OS X systems requires JDK 8 or higher to be installed. |
| Windows | 8 | 8 latest revision | **32-bit** (x86 / i586) (see note) | [Official Website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) | * The 32-bit version of the JDK is required regardless of whether Titanium is running on a 32-bit Windows system.<br />    <br />* Studio offers to install JDK 8 if no JDK is found.<br />    <br /><br />**Note**: From Studio 5.1.0 and up, 64-bit JDK is supported |

See [Installing Oracle JDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Oracle_JDK/) for detailed instructions.

#### Node.js

To run all Appcelerator components, you must have Node.js 8.0.0 or later.

On Mac OS X and Windows, if you have selected to install Titanium updates, Studio prompts you to install Node.js. On Linux, you need to manually install Node.js.
