{"title":"Navigating Open Files with Next Editor or Previous Editor","weight":"10"}

In Aptana Studio, instead of using **Alt+Tab** to navigate through a series of open files, use the keyboard shortcuts **Ctrl+Tab** and **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** to navigate between files that you have open in the editor.

* To go to the next file open in your editor, use the shortcut key combination of **Ctrl+Tab** or click the **Forward** button in the toolbar.

* To return to the previous file open in your editor, use the shortcut key combination of **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** or click the **Back** button in the toolbar.


You can also access this feature from the **Window** menu by selecting **Navigation > Next Editor** or **Navigation > Previous Editor**.
