* **Slack community**: The go-to source for real-time discussions with the Axway Appcelerator Developer community.

  * [http://tislack.org/](http://tislack.org/)

* **Stackoverflow**: [#appcelerator](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/appcelerator) at StackOverflow is the destination to log your specific questions or share your expertise.

Beyond the forums, also be sure to check out our [free video tutorials](http://videos.appcelerator.com/), which cover a wide range of development topics related to Titanium, API Builder, and beyond.

## Chat and Email Support

Users in trial or subscribers with Pro, Enterprise, or Mobile Backend Services plans can initiate a chat with our Support Team to request assistance on issues within our Scope of Support.

We have support engineers monitoring this channel 24/7. Response times are made on a “best effort” best basis depending on volumes, but we typically respond within 30 minutes. If you are not in the chat window when we respond, the reply will be emailed to you so you won’t miss it.

**Note**: For official enterprise support cases with guaranteed SLAs, the formal support portal and ticketing process should be used. Chat support is intended to provide quick assistance with lightweight technical inquiries. See the Enterprise Support section for more details.

## Scope of Support

We love helping developers succeed with our platform. However, there are boundaries what our support engineers can help with. Some of the limitations include:

* We don't touch client code. Your application code belongs to you. We offer suggestions or recommendations via sample use cases.

* We cannot provide application code-level debugging assistance

* Outdated versions of core are not supported on the Platform

* While we can assist, we cannot migrate your apps to newer releases of our products

* We don’t offer support for modules provided by 3rd parties. You will need to contact 3rd parties directly for support.

* New feature requests and feature enhancements are subject to review by our Product Management team for priority and scheduling. Enterprise customers should use the [Enterprise Support Portal](https://support.axway.com/). Guidelines for filing a feature request by the community can be found [here](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Contributing_to_Titanium/How_to_Report_a_Bug_or_Make_a_Feature_Request/).

* We can only assist if we can replicate the problem
