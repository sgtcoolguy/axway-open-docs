{"title":"Revert to a Previous Configuration of Studio","weight":"110"}

Although Axway Appcelerator Studio does provide this feature, it is not generally recommended and can leave your Studio in an unstable state.

## Reverting a Studio configuration

As you install, upgrade, and uninstall software into your system, configuration snapshots are kept in a history. Reverting to a previous configuration allows you to back out of the results of an unsuccessful install, upgrade, or uninstall. To revert to a saved configuration:

## Installing older versions of Studio

### Versions prior to 5.1.0

If you have a previous version of Studio installed, you can use the Revert feature found within Studio, as mentioned above.

If you don't have the version you are looking for, you can download the Studio package directly (see [below](#Directpackagedownloads)).

### Versions 5.1.0 and later

With Studio 5.1.0, as mentioned in [Cannot update from Studio 5.0.0 to Studio 5.1.0](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Release_Notes/Studio_Release_Notes_5.x/Studio_5.1.0.RC_Release_Note/Studio_5.1.0_Changes/#CannotupdatefromStudio5.0.0toStudio5.1.0), you cannot revert to previous versions of Studio as 5.1.0 and later requires removal of the older version and a fresh install.
