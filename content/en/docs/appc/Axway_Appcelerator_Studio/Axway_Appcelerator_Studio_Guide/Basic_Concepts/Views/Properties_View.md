This page describes what the Properties View is and how to display it.

## Introduction

The Properties View displays information depending on where your cursor is in the editor, or what you have selected. The information consists mostly of metadata for the selection; in other words, the selected text, the length, the offsets, the scope, and so forth.

## Opening the View

Studio does not display the Properties View in the Web Perspective by default. To open the view manually:

* From the **Window** menu, select **Show View > Other...**. Then search for **properties** in the search box that appears.

* To close the **Properties View**, click the Close button (**X**) in the upper right of the tab.

## Using the View

As mentioned above, the properties view will show different information depending on what is selected. For example, if I select a file in the App Explorer, it will show information like the name, location, last modified, and so forth.

If some text is selected in the editor, it will show information like the selected text, the length, the offsets, the scope, and so forth.

The scope shown is the same as the scope used in rubles development. This view can be used to determine which scope that you need to be used for a specific ruble command/snippet.
