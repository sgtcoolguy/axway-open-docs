## Overview

This page discusses how to switch the Aptana Studio interface to a different language, such as Japanese or Chinese.

You can change the language of the user interface to a different language than what your operating system uses by default. Follow the instructions below to change the language of the UI. Note that while a reasonable percentage of the core UI may be translated, items like Titanium-specific features have not so that they will appear in English.

## Downloading Translations

2. Add the update site, as specified by [Installing a Plugin](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Updating_Studio/Installing_a_Plugin/).

3. Expand the node for the language you are interested in, and click the "eclipse" item.

4. Continue through the wizard. Make sure you change your language settings, as noted below.
