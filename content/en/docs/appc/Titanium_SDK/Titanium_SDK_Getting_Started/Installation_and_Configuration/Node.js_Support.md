Titanium SDK has full NodeJS support so users can use NPM modules Android and iOS platforms.

## Minor differences

This implementation includes the NodeJS require algorithm with some minor differences:

*   SDK doesn't attempt to load \*.node files
    
*   SDK doesn't have replacements for Node's core modules
    
*   If the required string doesn't have the prefix of ./, /, or ../, and its not a native module, the SDK will fall back to legacy Titanium behavior of assuming the require is meant as "absolute" inside the app (as in starting at "Resources/")
    
*   The SDK will load JSON files and directories (package.json's main property (look at it, resolve it, and try to load it), index.js, and index.json)
    

## Algorithm summary

To summarize the algorithm the SDK uses, here are three summaries for requiring a module, loading as file, and loading as directory:

### Require(X) from module at path Y

1.  If X is a core module,
    
    1.  return the core module
        
    2.  STOP
        
2.  If X begins with ./, or ../,
    
    1.  LOAD\_AS\_FILE(Y + X)
        
    2.  LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(Y + X)
        
3.  If X begins with /,
    
    1.  LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)
        
    2.  LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)
        
4.  If X does not contain '/', assume it should try and load CommonJS module first....
    
    1.  LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X/X.js): try to load "legacy" CommonJS file named module.id/module.id.js.
        
    2.  LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X): try to load CommonJS module as a directory
        
5.  WARN user about possible bad require being treated as absolute THROW "not found"
    
    1.  LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)
        
    2.  LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)
        

### LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)

1.  If X is a file, load X as JavaScript text or JavaScript Object (JSON). STOP
    
2.  If X.js is a file, load X.js as JavaScript text. STOP
    
3.  If X.json is a file, parse X.json to a JavaScript Object. STOP
    

### LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)

1.  If X/package.json is a file, If X/index.js is a file, load X/index.js as JavaScript text. STOP
    
    1.  Parse X/package.json and look for "main" field.
        
    2.  let M = X + (json main field)
        
    3.  LOAD\_AS\_FILE(M)
        
2.  If X/index.json is a file, parse X/index.json to a JavaScript object. STOP
