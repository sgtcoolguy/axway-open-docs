## Overview

Rubles can reference environment variables during execution, and developers can contribute new environment variables as well.

## Referencing an environment variable

Environment variables are available through a hash. There are two methods of accessing them, depending on how they are used in the Ruby code:

* In statements: filepath.sub(ENV\['TM\_PROJECT\_DIRECTORY'\], '') : File.basename(filepath)

* Inside strings: rspec\_merb\_gem = (Dir\["#{ENV\['TM\_PROJECT\_DIRECTORY'\]}/gems/gems/rspec\*"\].first || ''))


Note the usage of #ENV\['keyname'\] inside strings.

## Setting an environment variable

You can also set variables into the same hash:

* In Ruby code: ENV\['TM\_DATE'\] = Time.now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

* Example:

  `template` `"XXX Template"`  `do` `|t|`

  `t.filetype =` `"*.xxx"`

  `t.invoke` `do` `|context|`

  `ENV[``'TM_DATE'``] = Time.now.strftime(``"%Y-%m-%d"``)`

  `raw_contents = IO.read(``"#{File.dirname(ENV['TM_BUNDLE_SUPPORT'])}/templates/yyy.xxx"``)`

  `raw_contents.gsub(/\$\{([Creating a` `new` `template^}]*)\}/) {|match| ENV[match[``2``..-``2``]] }`

  `end`

  `end`

Offset inside the line, from the beginning of of a line (0-based).

TM\_LINE\_INDEX

Offset inside the line, from the beginning of a line (0-based).

TM\_LINE\_NUMBER

The line number where the selection begins in the active editor (lines are 1-based).
