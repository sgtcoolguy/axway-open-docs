# Node.js Development

Node.js is a high-performance platform for developing networked applications, built on top of the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.

Inside Titanium Studio, Node.js is used for a variety of external tools, including Alloy, the updated SDK command-line interface, and additional products.

Node.js will be installed by default on first run if you don't have it as a separate application. This allows for simple usage both inside and outside Studio. See the child pages for additional information on installing, upgrading and using Node.js.
