## Quick Tutorial

The following tutorial demonstrates the basic setup and usage of Analytics and Cloud libraries in an Xcode project. To complete the tutorial, you will need your APS application key for the Cloud and Analytics services. [Download](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/APSiOSObjectiveC) a complete version of the project.

**To create a basic application using APS**:

1. In Xcode, create a new iOS Project (Single View Application).

2. Unzip appcelerator-sdk-ios-<VERSION>.zip file and drag the Appcelerator.framework folder into the root project folder if you are using Xcode 6 and above, or the Frameworks folder if you are using Xcode 5 or below.

3. Select **Copy items into destinationâ€¦** and click **Finish**.

4. Select your project in the Project Navigator and click the **Build Phases** tab.

5. Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** section and add the libsqlite3.tbd and libz.tbd frameworks. Before Xcode 7, the framework extension is dylib rather than tbd.

6. Click the **Build Settings** tab, then click the **All** button in the top-left corner of the tab.

7. If you are using Xcode 7, you will need to disable bit code since some third-party libraries do not have bit code enabled. Expand the **Build Options** section and set **Enable Bitcode** to **No**.

8. Expand the **Linking** section and add \-ObjC to **Other Linker Flags**.

9. In your application delegate implementation file, import **Appcelerator/Appcelerator.h.**

    `#``import` `<Appcelerator/Appcelerator.h>`

10. Add the following initialization code to your application delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method, replacing the placeholder string with your APS application key:

    `[[APSServiceManager sharedInstance] enableWithAppKey:@``"APS_APP_KEY"``];`

    The iOS application is now ready to make method calls using the APS SDK APIs.

If the application attempts to make APS SDK API calls without first setting the application key, the application will throw an exception and crash.

### Modify the Application

Customize the application's UI to display a picker, text field and button, and add some logic to respond to user interaction. The picker will display a list of available user accounts. The user can enter their password in the text field, then click the button to log in.

1. Open your project's Main.storyboard file.

2. Drag a Picker View, Text Field, and Button from the Object library to the view.

3. Open the **Assistant Editor**. (From the menu, select **View** > **Assistant Editor** \> **Show Assistant Editor** or click the **Assistant Editor** button in the top-right corner.)

4. In the right pane, display the ViewController.h file.

5. Control-drag the Picker View to **View Controller** icon at the bottom of the storyboard. Select **dataSource**. Repeat for the **delegate** option.

    ![PickerDataSourceDelegate](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298726/PickerDataSourceDelegate.png)
6. Drag the Picker View to the header file to create an IBOutlet. Name the outlet picker and click **Connect**. Repeat the same procedure for the Text Field and name it textField. ![CreateOutlet](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298726/CreateOutlet.png)

7. In the ViewController.h file, declare the View Controller to implement the UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource, and UITextFieldDelegate protocols. Add an NSArray property called usernames to keep track of the Picker View's data source and an NSString property called username to reference the current selection. The final header file should look like:

    ViewController.h

    `#``import` `<UIKit/UIKit.h>`

    `#``import` `<CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>`

    `@interface` `ViewController : UIViewController <UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource, UITextFieldDelegate>`

    `@property` `(weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIPickerView *picker;`

    `@property` `(weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITextField *textField;`

    `@property` `(strong, nonatomic) NSArray *usernames;`

    `@property` `(strong, nonatomic) NSString *username;`

    `@end`

8. In the ViewController.m file, create an IBAction for the button named doClick. In the following sections, you will add code to this handler that calls Cloud and Analytics services. The View Controller needs to implement the methods of UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource and UITextFieldDelegate protocols. Add the following code to the file:

    ViewController.m

    `#``import`  `"ViewController.h"`

    `// Add this import statement`

    `#``import` `<Appcelerator/Appcelerator.h>`

    `@implementation` `ViewController`

    `- (``void``)viewDidLoad`

    `{`

    `[``super` `viewDidLoad];`

    `// Add these statements to dismiss the keyboard`

    `self.textField.delegate = self;`

    `[self.textField resignFirstResponder];Â `

    `}`

    `- (``void``)didReceiveMemoryWarning`

    `{`

    `[``super` `didReceiveMemoryWarning];`

    `}`

    `// Add these methods`

    `- (IBAction)onClick:(id)sender {`

    `}`

    `#pragma mark Picker DataSource/Delegate`

    `- (NSInteger)numberOfComponentsInPickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView {`

    `return`  `1``;`

    `}`

    `- (NSInteger)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView numberOfRowsInComponent:(NSInteger)component {`

    `return` `_usernames.count;`

    `}`

    `- (NSString *)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView titleForRow:(NSInteger)row forComponent:(NSInteger)component {`

    `return` `[_usernames[row] objectForKey:@``"username"``];`

    `}`

    `- (``void``)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView didSelectRow:(NSInteger)row inComponent:(NSInteger)component {`

    `_username = [_usernames[row] objectForKey:@``"username"``];`

    `}`

    `#pragma mark TextField Delegate`

    `- (BOOL)textFieldShouldBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField`

    `{`

    `return` `YES;`

    `}`

    `- (BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)textField`

    `{`

    `[textField resignFirstResponder];`

    `return` `YES;`

    `}`

    `@end`

9. Control-drag the Button to the onClick:sender method to create an action connection.

    ![ConnectAction](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298726/ConnectAction.png)

### Send an Analytics Feature Event

The Analytics library automatically captures and sends application life-cycle events to the backend Analytics service. You can also send custom analytics events, as shown in this example. You can use feature events as one type of custom events.

In the doClick method, add a sendAppFeatureEvent: method call to send a feature event with the string "sample.feature.login". The optional payload parameter is set to nil for this example, but it lets you send additional data along with the event.

`- (IBAction)doClick:(id)sender {`

`// Call Analytics method`

`[[APSAnalytics sharedInstance] sendAppFeatureEvent:@``"sample.feature.login"` `payload:nil];`

`}`

### Query Cloud Users

To use the APS Cloud component, most of the methods require a user to be logged in. This sample uses the Picker View to select a Cloud user account. To populate the Picker View values, the application needs to retrieve a list of users. Call the query:withBlock: method to retrieve a list of user accounts from inside the viewDidLoad method.

Every APS Cloud method includes a withBlock parameter that specifies the callback to handle the server response. The callback is passed an APSResponse object that contains response metadata (such as success or failure) and the response payload.

ViewController.m

`- (``void``)viewDidLoad`

`{`

`[``super` `viewDidLoad];`

`// Call the APSUsers query method`

`[APSUsers query:nil withBlock:^(APSResponse *e){`

`if` `(e.success) {`

`_usernames = [e.response objectForKey:@``"users"``];`

`[self.picker reloadAllComponents];`

`}` `else` `{`

`UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@``"Error"`

`message:@``"Unable to retrieve user accounts!"`

`delegate:nil`

`cancelButtonTitle:@``"OK"`

`otherButtonTitles: nil];`

`[alert show];`

`}`

`}];`

`}`

### Log in to a Cloud Account

To log in to a Cloud account, you need the username and password. Since the application was modified to get all available user accounts and populate the Picker View, the application needs to get the current value of the picker and the text entered in the Text Field. These values are passed to the login:withBlock: method. Modify the doClick method to login to a Cloud user account.

ViewController.m

`- (IBAction)doClick:(id)sender {`

`[[APSAnalytics sharedInstance] sendAppFeatureEvent:@``"sample.feature.login"` `payload:nil];`

`// Construct the request parameters`

`NSDictionary *params = [[NSDictionary alloc]`

`initWithObjectsAndKeys:_username,@``"login"``,`

`[_textField text],@``"password"``,`

`nil];`

`// Call the APSUsers login method`

`[APSUsers login:params withBlock:^(APSResponse *e){`

`if` `(e.success) {`

`NSLog(@``"Successfully logged in as %@"``, _username);`

`}` `else` `{`

`NSLog(@``"ERROR: Failed to log in!"``);`

`}`

`}];`

`}Â `

### Log a Handled Exception

The Performance library automatically logs application crashes (unhandled exceptions) and handled exceptions to the backend Performance service. You can also leave breadcrumbs in your application, which are developer-defined text strings (up to 140 characters) that are analogous to log messages.

For example, you can replace the Log calls in the catch statements with logHandledException calls. Instead, the application will generate a runtime exception, and then call the logHandledException method to log that exception to the Performance backend. To the doClick method, add the following new code:

`- (IBAction)doClick:(id)sender {`

`// Analytics call...`

`// Cloud call...`

`@try` `{`

`[NSException raise:NSGenericException format:@``"Something happened..."``];`

`}` `@catch` `(NSException *exception) {`

`[[APSPerformance sharedInstance] logHandledException:exception];`

`}`

`}`

### Set a Username for Crash Logs

To help differentiate crash logs, use the username property. When the application successfully logs in to the Cloud user account, the application sets the username property.

ViewController.m

`- (IBAction)doClick:(id)sender {`

`[APSUsers login:params withBlock:^(APSResponse *e){`

`if` `(e.success) {`

`NSLog(@``"Successfully logged in as %@"``, _username);`

`// Add this APS Performance method call`

`[[APSPerformance sharedInstance] username] = _username;`

`}` `else` `{`

`NSLog(@``"ERROR: Failed to log in!"``);`

`}`

`}];`

`}Â `

### Testing the tutorial sample

Before testing the sample, you need to create user accounts for the application to query. To create Cloud user accounts:

1. Login to the [AMPLIFY Platform](https://platform.axway.com/).

2. On the Dashboard tile, select **Go to Dashboard**.

3. Select your application from the Projects menu.

4. In the left navigation bar, click **Manage** **Data**.

5. Click **Users**, then the **Create User** button.

6. In the **Username** field, enter the user's username.

7. In the **Password** field, enter the new user's password (four-character minimum).

8. Click **Save Changes**.

To create a Cloud user account, you only need a username or e-mail address and a password.

For more information about managing Cloud user accounts, see [Managing Organizations](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Managing_Organizations/).

After you have created a few Cloud user accounts, build the sample and launch it on either a device or emulator.

Once the application launches:

1. Click on the Picker/Spinner. You should see a list of all the Cloud user accounts you added.

2. Select a user account from the Picker/Spinner and enter that user's password. Click the Button. In the log output, you should see an info log that login command was successful or not.

3. Go back to the [Dashboard](https://platform.axway.com/).

4. In Dashboard, select your application from the **Apps** menu in the upper-left corner.

5. In the left navbar, click **Search by User**. Enter the username of the account that successfully logged in. Click the username. You should see a crash report for the user.

6. In the left navbar, select **Analytics**.

7. In the Real-Time view, you should see at least one active session.

8. In the left navbar, click **Events**. You should see the "sample.feature.login" feature event.
