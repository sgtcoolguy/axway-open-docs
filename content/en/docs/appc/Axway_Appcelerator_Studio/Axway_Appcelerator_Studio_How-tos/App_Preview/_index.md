## App Preview configuration for previously published apps

App Preview configuration will be different if you have previously published the application to App Preview.

Following the steps above for [iOS](#iOSAppPreview) and [Android](#AndroidAppPreview) App Preview should be the same. What is slightly different is the App Preview Configuration window will include options for notification. Those notification options include:

*   **None**: This option will not add any previous testers to a new build.
    
*   **Notify All**: Adds all previous testers to a new build and send them an email.
    
*   **Add All**: Adds all previous testers to a new build but it won't send an email.
    
*   **Add/Notify selective teams**: This option will allow the user add or notify only selective teams. It will accept the team names separated by commas.
