Titanium Angular comes with a set of helpers that provide a modernized access to commonly used features of our Titanium SDK. All of these employ a Promise-based API and try to abstract away repetitive steps from the original Titanium APIs. However, they are purely a convenience feature and won't replace any existing Titanium APIs.

## User Interface

### Dialogs

To ease the creation of dialogs, Titanium Angular comes with several predefined dialogs.

#### AlertDialog

The AlertDialog helper allows you to display a simple alert with a single button. Besides the dialog's title and message you can also specify an optional okButtonText.

AlertDialog

`import { AlertDialog } from` `'titanium-angular'``;`

`const alertDialog =` `new` `AlertDialog({`

`title:` `'Alert'``,`

`message:` `'This is awesome!'`

`});`

``alertDialog.show().then(() => console.log(`Alert closed`));``

#### ConfirmDialog

A confirm dialog will display a dialog using the title and message properties. You can also change the button text through the okButtonText and cancelButtonText options.

ConfirmDialog

`import { ConfirmDialog, ConfirmResult } from` `'titanium-angular'``;`

`const confirmDialog =` `new` `ConfirmDialog({`

`title:` `'Confirm'``,`

`message:` `'Do you want to continue?'`

`});`

`confirmDialog.show().then((result: ConfirmResult) => {`

`if` `(result === ConfirmResult.Ok) {`

`console.log(``'Confirmed!'``);`

`}` `else`  `if` `(result === ConfirmResult.Cancel) {`

`console.log(``'Canceled!'``);`

`}`

`});`

#### Prompt Dialog

To prompt a user for some text input you can use the prompt dialog.

**This has not yet been impletement with the current tech preview.**

#### Custom Dialogs

Besides those predefined dialogs you can also completely customize your dialogs using the BaseDialog class. A base dialog accepts the title and message options. You can then add multiple DialogAction to your dialog which represent a button of the dialog with a title and an optional handler function to call if that button is pressed.

BaseDialog

`import { BaseDialog, DialogAction } from` `'titanium-angular'``;`

`const dialog =` `new` `BaseDialog(``'Dialog title'``,` `'Some message'``);`

`// Add a simple button`

`dialog.addAction(``new` `DialogAction(``'Ok'``, () => console.log(``'Ok button pressed!'``)));`

`// Add a button representing the cancel action.`

`const cancelAction =` `new` `DialogAction(``'Cancel'``, () => console.log(``'Are you really gonna quit now?'``));`

`cancelAction.cancel =` `true``;`

`dialog.addAction(cancelAction);`

`// Add a button with the destructive option`

`const destructiveAction =` `new` `DialogAction(``'Abort'``, () => console.log(``'Ok ok, we are done here.'``));`

`destructiveAction.destructive =` `true``;`

`dialog.addAction(destructiveAction);`

By default both the cancel and destructive properties are set to false.

### Picker (Android only)

Handle the common use case of date and time pickers presented as modals with the following helper classes.

#### Time Picker

A simple time picker can be created with a minDate, maxValue, and value options. All of those options are optional and will accept a Date object. Passing an empty options object results in no restrictions on the selectable time frame and the current time will be pre-selected.

TimePicker

`const timePicker =` `new` `TimePicker({});`

`timePicker.show().then(selectedTime => {`

``console.log(`Selected time: ${selectedTime}`);``

`}).``catch``(() => {`

`console.log(``'Time selection canceled'``);`

`});`

#### Date Picker

Selecting both the date and a time can be achieved with the date picker. It accepts the minDate, maxValue and value options. All of those options are optional and will accept a Date object. Passing an empty options object results in no restrictions on the selectable dates and the current date and time will be pre-selected.

DatePicker

`const datePicker =` `new` `DatePicker({});`

`datePicker.show().then(selectedDate => {`

``console.log(`Selected date: ${selectedDate}`);``

`}).``catch``(() => {`

`console.log(``'Date selection canceled'``);`

`});`

## Device

### Device environment

Allows to check on which platform the app is currently running.

`@Component({templateUrl:` `"./some.component.html"``})`

`class SomeComponent implements OnInit {`

`constructor(private device: DeviceEnvironment) {`

`}`

`onInit() {`

`if` `(``this``.device.runs(``'android'``)) {`

`// ...`

`}`

`}`

`}`

Valid platform names are android, ios, and windows.
