*Enterprise Subscription Required!*

This AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services feature requires an Enterprise Subscription.

If you are an administrator of your organization, you can create child organizations under your parent organization. Child organizations share the user and device resources with the parent organization and cannot be allotted more than what the parent has not used.

If your organization is an authorized AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Reseller and you are an admin user, you can create two kinds of organization:

* Internal organizations, called **Groups**, are the same as children organizations that will use your parent organization's allotted user and device resources.

* External organizations, called **Customers**, is a group that has purchased the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services, which is allotted a pool of user and device resources.

To create an organization:

1. Sign in to the [AMPLIFY Platform](https://platform.axway.com).

2. Click on the _User_ dropdown menu and select **Organization**.

3. If you're a member of multiple organizations, select the organization from the **Organization** dropdown menu you want to which you want to add an organization.

4. On the **Organization** tab, click the **Action Menu** icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and select either **New Child Org** or **New Org**.

5. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the organization.
