## About AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Services Native SDKs

AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Services SDK for iOS and Android provides support for Appcelerator Analytics, Cloud, Performance and Test services for your Android applications built with the native Android APIs and Java, and iOS applications built with the native iOS APIs and Objective-C.

## At a Glance

### Getting Started

To incorporate Appcelerator Services into your Android or iOS application you need to download the APS SDK, obtain an application key to use the services, then modify your project to include the libraries and initialize the services.

See the following topics for getting started with the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Service SDK:

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [Quick Start Guide for iOS APS SDK](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/Quick_Start_Guide_for_iOS_APS_SDK/).

For native iOS applications built with Swift, see the [Quick Start Guide for iOS APS SDK using Swift](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/Quick_Start_Guide_for_iOS_APS_SDK_using_Swift/).

### Appcelerator Analytics

Appcelerator Analytics collects and presents information in real time about your application's user acquisition, engagement, and usage. Use the APSAnalytics API to send custom analytic events for navigation, geolocation and feature events.

See the following topics for Appcelerator Analytics Service:

For native Android applications built with Java, see the [APS Analytics for Android guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_Android/APS_Analytics_for_Android/) and [APSAnalytics Android API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/android/com/appcelerator/aps/APSAnalytics.html).

![ios_icon](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298720/ios_icon.png)

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [APS Analytics for iOS guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/APS_Analytics_for_iOS/) and [APSAnalytics iOS API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/ios/Classes/APSAnalytics.html).

### Appcelerator Cloud

Appcelerator Cloud provides an interface to Mobile Backend Services, which includes access to pre-defined REST objects and push notification services, respectively. Your application uses the APSCloud class and supporting cloud object classes to access Mobile Backend Services with Java or Objective-C calls.

See the following topics for Appcelerator Cloud Service:

For native Android applications built with Java, see the [APS Cloud for Android guide](/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/android) and [APSCloud Android API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/android/com/appcelerator/aps/APSCloud.html).

![ios_icon](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298720/ios_icon.png)

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [APS Cloud for iOS guide](/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/ios) and [APSCloud iOS API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/ios/Classes/APSCloud.html).

### Appcelerator Performance

Appcelerator Performance provides support for real-time crash reporting and app monitoring to capture errors and provide valuable diagnostic information of your mobile application. This information is sent and displayed in the Dashboard. To collect basic crash reports, simply initialize the Performance service with the APSPerformance API. This API also provides the ability to collect more valuable diagnostic data and capture exceptions.

See the following topics for Appcelerator Performance Service:

For native Android applications built with Java, see the [APS Performance for Android guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_Android/APS_Performance_for_Android/) and [APSPerformance Android API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/android/com/appcelerator/aps/APSPerformance.html).

![ios_icon](/Images/appc/download/attachments/43298720/ios_icon.png)

For native iOS applications built with Objective-C, see the [APS Performance for iOS guide](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_for_iOS/APS_Performance_for_iOS/) and [APSPerformance iOS API Reference](http://docs.appcelerator.com/aps-sdk-apidoc/latest/ios/Classes/APSPerformance.html).

### Appcelerator Test

To use Appcelerator Test, use the appcelerator-test utility to install drivers to the application and register each device or emulator you want to test your application on. Then, use the Dashboard to create test clips and execute test compositions.

**Relevant Chapter:** [Appcelerator Test](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Guide/Appcelerator_Test/), [Appcelerator Test CLI Reference](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Platform_Services_How-tos/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs/Appcelerator_Test_CLI_Reference/)

### Dashboard

Once you have your application setup to use Appcelerator Services, use Dashboard to monitor your application and view metrics about it. Dashboard lets you view and diagnose your mobile application's health and usage statistics. The Dashboard provides a lot of technical data about your application.
