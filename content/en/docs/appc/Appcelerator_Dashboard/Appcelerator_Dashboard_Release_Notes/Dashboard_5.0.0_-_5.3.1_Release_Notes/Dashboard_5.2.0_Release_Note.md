## Dashboard 5.2.0 - 28 September 2018

Dashboard 5.2.0 is a minor release, which includes several new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

*   Switching logged-in organizations is now performed from the **User** drop-down menu in the right of the header or from the user's _Organizations_ view instead of a separate drop-down menu.
    
*   Added links to user's _Organizations_ view and current org's _Members_ view in the **User** drop-down menu in the header.
    
*   Provided the ability to select a default organization or to be prompted which organization to log into during authentication. This feature is available to users who are members of multiple organizations and may be configured on the user's _Organizations_ view.
    
*   Added top application to the _API Runtime Requests_ widget on the **Overview** tab.
