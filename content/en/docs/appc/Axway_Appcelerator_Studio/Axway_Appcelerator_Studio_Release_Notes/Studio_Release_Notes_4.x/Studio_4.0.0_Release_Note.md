As of this release, Studio 3.x will not be supported one calendar year from 4.0.0.GA's release date. See [Axway Appcelerator Deprecation Policy](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Deprecation_Policy/) and [Nominal Lifetimes](/docs/appc/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Overview/Axway_Appcelerator_Product_Lifecycle/#NominalLifetimes) documents for details.

## New features

* Integration with the Appcelerator CLI.

* New installers for OS X and Windows with silent installation capabilities, and prerequisite detection and installation, as well as a new UI for the OS X installer. For details, see [Setting up Studio: Installing Studio](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Setting_up_Studio/#installingstudioInstallingStudio).

* Update Eclipse base from 4.3 (Kepler) to 4.4 (Lunar).

* Update content assist in Alloy to suggest:

  * <ActionBar/> element as child of a <TabGroup/> or <Window/> element

  * <AndroidView/> element as a child of a <AlertDialog/> element

  * Titanium.Andriod.ActionBar properties as attributes in the <Menu/> element

  * <FixedSpace/> as a shorthand for <Button systemButton=â€œTi.UI.iPhone.SystemButton.FIXED\_SPACE>

  * <KeyboardToolbar/> element as a child of a <TextArea/> element

  * <LeftNavButtons/> and <RightNavButtons/> as a child of a <Window/> element

  * Shorthand notation for Ti.UI.KEYBOARD\_\* and Ti.UI.RETURNKEY\_\* constants

* Add hyperlink detector to jump from i18n translation keys in JavaScript properties, TSS attributes, XML node text and XML localized attributes, such as titleid, to their definition in strings.xml files. In an Alloy JavaScript, TSS or XML file, hold the **Command** key for Macs or **Control** key for Linux and Windows, then hover over a localized function with an i18n translation key. The localized function turns into a hyperlink. Click the hyperlink to jump to the entry in the i18n/en/strings.xml file. You can also click on the i18n translation key and hit the **F3** key. Previously, this feature was only supported with the localization functions in the XML files.


## Known issues

### Mobile web application does not launch in the browser

After building a mobile web application in Studio, Studio does not launch the application in a browser ([TISTUD-7428](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TISTUD-7428)). To workaround this issue, create your own web server to launch the application. Instructions will be available in the linked ticket.
