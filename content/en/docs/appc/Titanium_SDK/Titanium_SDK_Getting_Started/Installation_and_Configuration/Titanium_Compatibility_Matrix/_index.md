## Node.js

To run all Appcelerator components, you must have Node.js 8.0.0 or later.

On Mac OS X and Windows, if you have selected to install Titanium updates, Studio prompts you to install Node.js. On Linux, you need to manually install Node.js.

![download_05](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004836/download_05.png)

| Operating System | Min Node Version | Max Node Version | Download Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS / Windows / Linux | 8.0 | 10.X | [Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) |

See [Installing Node](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Node/) for details.

## Appcelerator Studio

Appcelerator Studio is a Java application, which requires Oracle's Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. As JRE is a component of Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) and JDK is a prerequisite for development with other SDKs, JDK needs to be installed on all systems working with Titanium. Refer to the [Java Development Kit](#java-development-kit) section of this document.

Use the latest stable version of Studio.

See [Titanium SDK Getting Started](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/) for setup guide for further instructions.

## Mobile development

Titanium can provide a development environment for third-party mobile platforms where a Software Development Kit (SDK) has been made available by the platform vendor. With this in mind, development with the following combinations of Operating Systems and SDKs are possible:

| Platform | macOS | Windows | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android Development | ![check](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/check.png)  <br />(tick) | ![check](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/check.png)  <br />(tick) |  |
| iOS Development | ![check](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/check.png)  <br />(tick) | ![error](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/error.png)  <br />(error) | Due to Apple's license agreement, iOS applications may only be developed on Apple hardware. |
| Windows Development | ![error](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/error.png)  <br />(error) | ![check](/Images/appc/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/check.png)  <br />(tick) | Windows applications may only be developed on hardware running Microsoft Windows.<br /><br />Currently, Windows development is only supported using the Titanium CLI 3.3.0 and later, Titanium SDK 3.3.0 and later, and Visual Studio 2012/2013 Pro edition or higher. |

### Android

See [Installing the Android SDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Platform_SDKs/Installing_the_Android_SDK/) for detailed instructions.

Titanium requires the Android SDK Tools to be installed in order to allow you to develop Android applications.

Remember that Oracle JDK is a prerequisite for Android development and should be installed first. You need at least JDK 8 installed. See [Installing Oracle JDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Oracle_JDK/) for instructions.

![download_02](/Images/appc/download/attachments/52297851/download_02.png)

The _Android SDK Manager_ installer may be obtained from the [Android Studio and SDK tools](https://developer.android.com/studio) site.

#### Required Android Packages

As of Titanium 9.0.0, the build system will automatically download the Android SDK platforms and tools needed.

For Titanium 8.x.x, you need to installed the following packages via the Android SDK Manager yourself:

| Package | Minimum Version |
| --- | --- |
| Android SDK Tools | Rev 28 |
| Android SDK Build-tools | Rev 23 |
| Android SDK Platform (API Level) | API Level 29 for Titanium 8.3.x<br /><br />API Level 28 for Titanium version older than 8.3.0 |

Titanium SDK 7.0.0+ requires Android SDK Tools v25 or newer as a minimum requirement.

Take caution before upgrading these packages, as changes to the way they work has broken the Titanium toolchain a number of times in the past. Although these problems are often beyond our control, we always do our utmost to fix them as soon as we are made aware of them.

With this in mind, it's important to only upgrade these packages _between_ major projects, so that you have time to fix any problems that may result. Always consult the Android Tools [Release Notes](http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html) and [Known Issues](http://tools.android.com/knownissues) first, and refer to our [Installation Troubleshooting](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installation_Troubleshooting/) guide to check whether there are any further actions that need to be taken to make the Titanium and the Android SDK compatible.

#### Android SDK / Target Android platform

Each Titanium SDK supports building against a specific range of Android versions, as shown in the following table, and requires at least one of these versions to be installed. If you specify a android:targetSDKVersion in the tiapp.xml file of your project, you must specify one within the target min and max values. The minimum Android/SDK version column indicates the minimum version of Android that a device can run, which a Titanium application supports.

##### Supported versions

| Titanium SDK Version | Min Target Android/SDK Version  <br />(android:targetSdkVersion) | Max Target Android/SDK Version  <br />(android:targetSdkVersion) | Minimum Android/SDK Version  <br />(android:minSdkVersion) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Notes

\* If you are building an Android module, you need to have Android SDK 6.0.x (API 23) installed if using Release 6.0.0 and greater.

\*\* The Titanium SDK does not support the [Android 4.4W SDK](http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html) (API 20), also known as the Android Wear SDK.

Most mobile device manufacturers have been licensed to use Google's enhanced API, which provides support for Maps and other functionality. If this is the case for your target devices, you will need to install the relevant Google packages, listed as _Google APIs by Google Inc., Android API x..._ by the **Android SDK Manager** tool. In Studio, choose the SDKs with the naming format "Google APIs x.x" to use the enhanced APIs, or those without the "Google APIs" prefix otherwise.

Android SDK packages can be installed using the **Android SDK Manager** tool. See [Installing the Android SDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Platform_SDKs/Installing_the_Android_SDK/) for detailed instructions.

The default Android SDK can be configured using Studio's _Preferences_, and then selected per-project using the _Run Configurations_.

#### Android Native Add-on Module Development on macOS

The Xcode command line tools are required to develop native Android add-on modules on macOS.

See [Installing the iOS SDK: Installing Command Line Tools](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/DB/Installing+the+iOS+SDK#InstallingtheiOSSDK-InstallingCommandLineToolsandPreviousSimulators) for detailed instructions.

### iOS

See [Installing the iOS SDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Platform_SDKs/Installing_the_iOS_SDK/) for detailed instructions.

Titanium requires Xcode to be installed in order for you to develop iOS applications.

![download_05](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004836/download_05.png)

There are two ways to obtain Xcode, the application that installs and manages iOS SDKs:

1. Launch the _App Store_ application, found in the Applications folder, and search for and install "Xcode" (includes the stable iOS and watchOS SDKs).

2. Enroll with the Apple Developer website and browse the [iOS Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/download/) page to manually download the installer application (includes all previously-released iOS SDKs and new Beta versions).

Both of the above options are free of charge, although may require credit card details to be entered. Since 2016, you can also test your apps on your device using the free Apple developer program. If you wish to deploy your applications to the App Store for production, however, you will need to become a member of the _iOS Developer Program_, by way of an annual subscription charge of $99 at the time of writing.

#### Xcode

To develop for iOS, Titanium requires Apple's Xcode suite of tools.

Each Titanium SDK supports a specific range of Xcode versions, shown in the table below.

##### Supported versions of Xcode

### Ant

Titanium 9.0.0 and newer versions no longer use Apache Ant. The below only applies to older SDK versions.

Apache Ant is the standard build tool for Java. It can be used to build Titanium native Android modules and to build the Titanium SDK for Android. Ant is not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

Java is a prerequisite for Ant, and should be installed first. See [Installing Oracle JDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Oracle_JDK/) for instructions.

Obtain the latest stable version of Apache Ant. Ant is supplied as a multi-platform archive. You can choose the archive format that's easiest for you to extract: all archives contain the same files.
