## Installing Android Studio, Android SDK, and Android Virtual Device

If you don't see any devices to build on, it's likely you don't have any Android SDKs and/or Android Virtual Devices set up. This section will walk you through the basic steps to install these required components.

### Install Android SDK

The Android SDK can be downloaded from within [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

With Android Studio installed, follow these steps to set up a recent SDK:

1.  Launch **Android Studio**.
    
2.  Click on **Tools** > **SDK Manager**.
    
3.  Place a **checkmark** next to the **SDK** you wish to install and click **OK** to begin the download and installation.

### Install Android Virtual Device

To test your app, you need either a device connected to your machine or a virtual device. This section covers how to set up a virtual device via Android Studio so that the device will appear in VS Code.

1.  Launch **Android Studio**.
    
2.  Click on **Tools** > **AVD Manager**.
    
3.  Click on **Create Virtual Device...**.
    
4.  Select **Phone** from the **Category** panel.
    
5.  At the time of writing this document, Pixel XL is a popular device. So, we'll pick that one from the list and click on Next.
    
6.  For the system image, Oreo (API level 27) should work for this virtual device. Click **Next**.
    
7.  There's no real need to change any of the settings in **Verify Configuration** window. Click **Finish** to build the virtual device.
    
8.  Load your IDE and confirm that the Android emulator shows up.

## Install iOS simulator

If you need to build apps for iOS devices, you will need Xcode to install the necessary iOS simulators for testing.

1.  Launch **Xcode**.
    
2.  Click **Xcode** \> **Preferences** \> **Components**.
    
3.  Click on the **simulator version** you wish to download and use. Note: these are pretty large files (2+ GB).
    
4.  Wait for the download to complete before checking in with your IDE of choice to confirm that the simulator now shows up.
