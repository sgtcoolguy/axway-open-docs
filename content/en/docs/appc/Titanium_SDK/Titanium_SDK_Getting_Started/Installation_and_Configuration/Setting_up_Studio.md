## Getting help overview

This guide walkthroughs the setup of **Axway Appcelerator Studio** (Studio). Although using Studio is not mandatory for mobile application development, which can be done using a text editor and our [command-line tools](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_CLI/), we believe that it is the most effective way to speed up your development process and increase your productivity when building quality applications using Alloy and the Titanium SDK.

## Compatibility and download

Use the latest stable version of Studio.

![download_05](/Images/appc/download/attachments/29004836/download_05.png)

**[Sign up](http://www.appcelerator.com/signup/)** for an _AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services_ account and **[log in](https://platform.appcelerator.com/#/tools)** to download the installer.

## Preparing for Studio

### System requirements

A system must satisfy the following requirements in order to run Studio.

#### Memory

| Product | Host Operating System | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Appcelerator Studio | All | 1 GB (contiguous) |
| Latest Android SDK | macOS | 1.5 GB (contiguous) |
| Latest Android SDK | Windows | 1 GB (contiguous) |

{{% alert title="⚠️ Warning" color="primary" %}}Minimum system memory requirements is 8GB of RAM. 16GB is highly recommended.{{% /alert %}}

#### Disk space

We recommend the following as a guideline for estimating how much disk space is necessary to build applications using Axway Appcelerator Studio:

| Application | Recommended disk space | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xcode | 15 - 20GB | Xcode includes the latest iOS and related simulator(s). |
| Android Studio | 10 - 15GB | You may need to select with SDK(s), NDK(s), and emulators to use. |
| Axway Appcelerator Studio | ~250MB |  |
| Genymotion | ~1GB | Genymotion is optional |
| Mobile app (workspace) | 50MB - 3GB | Disk usage depends on many factors. |

#### Operating system

Titanium is supported on the following Operating Systems:

| Operating System | Version |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | 10.11.5 (Mavericks) and later |
| Windows | Windows 7 and later(Android)  <br />Windows 8.1 and later (Windows Phone)  <br />Windows 10 and later (Windows 10 Mobile) |

{{% alert title="❗️ Warning" color="danger" %}}As of Titanium 9.0.0, building Windows apps is no longer supported.{{% /alert %}}{{% alert title="❗️ Warning" color="danger" %}}Support for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone SDKs has been deprecated as of SDK 6.3.0.GA and has be removed in SDK 7.0.0.GA.{{% /alert %}}

#### Node.js

* [Minor differences](#Node.jsSupport-Minordifferences)

* [Algorithm summary](#Node.jsSupport-Algorithmsummary)

    * [Require(X) from module at path Y](#Node.jsSupport-Require(X)frommoduleatpathY)

    * [LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)](#Node.jsSupport-LOAD_AS_FILE(X))

    * [LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)](#Node.jsSupport-LOAD_AS_DIRECTORY(X))

Titanium SDK has full NodeJS support so users can use NPM modules Android and iOS platforms.

## Minor differences

This implementation includes the NodeJS require algorithm with some minor differences:

* SDK doesn't attempt to load \*.node files

* SDK doesn't have replacements for Node's core modules

* If the required string doesn't have the prefix of ./, /, or ../, and its not a native module, the SDK will fall back to legacy Titanium behavior of assuming the require is meant as "absolute" inside the app (as in starting at "Resources/")

* The SDK will load JSON files and directories (package.json's main property (look at it, resolve it, and try to load it), index.js, and index.json)

## Algorithm summary

To summarize the algorithm the SDK uses, here are three summaries for requiring a module, loading as file, and loading as directory:

### Require(X) from module at path Y

1. If X is a core module,

    1. return the core module

    2. STOP

2. If X begins with ./, or ../,

    1. LOAD\_AS\_FILE(Y + X)

    2. LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(Y + X)

3. If X begins with /,

    1. LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)

    2. LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)

4. If X does not contain '/', assume it should try and load CommonJS module first....

    1. LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X/X.js): try to load "legacy" CommonJS file named module.id/module.id.js.

    2. LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X): try to load CommonJS module as a directory

5. WARN user about possible bad require being treated as absolute THROW "not found"

    1. LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)

    2. LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)

### LOAD\_AS\_FILE(X)

1. If X is a file, load X as JavaScript text or JavaScript Object (JSON). STOP

2. If X.js is a file, load X.js as JavaScript text. STOP

3. If X.json is a file, parse X.json to a JavaScript Object. STOP

### LOAD\_AS\_DIRECTORY(X)

1. If X/package.json is a file, If X/index.js is a file, load X/index.js as JavaScript text. STOP

    1. Parse X/package.json and look for "main" field.

    2. let M = X + (json main field)

    3. LOAD\_AS\_FILE(M)

2. If X/index.json is a file, parse X/index.json to a JavaScript object. STOP

### Software locations

The default and recommended software locations of a successful Titanium installation on each platform are described in [Software Locations and Environment Variables](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Software_Locations_and_Environment_Variables/).

## Installing Studio

The installation procedure for Studio differs depending on the platform.
