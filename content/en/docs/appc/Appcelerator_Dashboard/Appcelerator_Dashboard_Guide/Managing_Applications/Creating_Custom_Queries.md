## Introduction

By default, Dashboard provides metric analytics for AMPLIFY Runtime Requests, Average Session Length, Install, Events, Mobile Backend Service Requests, Push Notifications, Sessions, and Unique Devices. The Custom Queries feature enables you to create custom queries based on your application-specific metrics and analytical needs or expand upon the provided default analytics to meet your specific analytics needs.

## Queries Overview

To access the _Queries Overview_ screen, select the **Custom Queries** tab on the Dashboard home page.

Note that if you have not created any custom queries, selecting the **Custom Queries** tab will transfer you to the _Queries_ screen. The _Queries_ screen enables creating, previewing, editing, saving, and deleting custom analytics queries. You can also filter custom queries. To access the _Queries_ screen from the _Queries Overview_ screen, click the **\+ Query** button or click on a custom query tile. To navigate from the _Queries_ screen to the _Queries Overview_ screen, select **All Queries** from the Saved Queries drop-down menu.

    `{`
    
    `"$match"``: {`
    
    `"event"``:` `"app.install"``,`

### Delete Filters

To delete a filter, select the **Delete** icon associated with the filter to delete.

## Custom Data Query Example

If a featureEvent is specified:

`function doClick(e) {`

`Ti.Analytics.featureEvent(``'testFeature'``,`

`{`

`testString:` `'hello world'`

`}`

`);`

`alert($.label.text);`

`}`

`$.index.open();`

The query to filter on the data testString that is attached to the featureEvent would be a data.testString equal to hello world.
