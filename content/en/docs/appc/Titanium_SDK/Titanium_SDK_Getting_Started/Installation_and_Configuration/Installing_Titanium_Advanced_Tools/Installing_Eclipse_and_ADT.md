## Compatibility and download

The Eclipse IDE can be used to build and debug Titanium Android modules, and to build and debug the Titanium SDK on Android. You will also need to install the Android Development Tools (ADT) Eclipse plugin.

ADT has been discontinued and we don't recommend using it.

Eclipse and ADT are not required for building, running, or distributing applications using the Titanium SDK.

If you don't want to use Eclipse, you can build Android modules and the Titanium SDK on the command line using Ant. See [Installing Ant](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Installation_and_Configuration/Installing_Titanium_Advanced_Tools/Installing_Ant/) for instructions.

Java is a prerequisite for Eclipse, and should be installed first. See [Installing Oracle JDK](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Getting_Started/Prerequisites/Installing_Oracle_JDK/) for instructions.

Obtain the Eclipse version listed below for your Operating System:
