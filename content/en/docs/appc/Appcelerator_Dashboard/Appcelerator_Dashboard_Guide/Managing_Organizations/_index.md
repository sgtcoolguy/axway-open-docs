## Introduction

As an administrator, the AMPLIFY Platform lets you view details about your organization, manage the users who have access to the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services, and manage the applications created by members of your organization. All of these functions are available through the **Organization** tab. To access the **Organization** tab, sign in to the [AMPLIFY Platform](https://platform.axway.com) and select **Organization** from the _User_ dropdown menu.

## Concepts

Users belong to organizations. An organization is a group of people working for the same entity â€“ typically the members of a company or some subset of a company.

*   Organization _members_ can create new Titanium applications in Appcelerator Studio or register an Android or iOS application in Dashboard. These applications belong to the organization the user-designated during the app creation process.
    
*   Organization _admins_ can create applications, invite users to join the organization, and assign organization members to _application teams_.
    

A user can have different administrator rights:

*   _Org Admin_ gives the user access to manage the organization.
    
*   _AMPLIFY Runtime Services Admin_ gives the user access to manage AMPLIFY Runtime Services application associated with the organization using the appc acs CLI, including republishing or remove applications.
    

A user can be a member of multiple organizations. In this case, the user will see an organization switcher in the _Profile_ dropdown located in the top-right of the Dashboard.

An application team is a group of people working on a single application. Application team members can have different roles:

*   _Application admins_ can add users to the application team, change user roles, and update or modify the application's data. The user who creates an application becomes an admin for that application by default. Some ACS APIs can only be called by application admins.
    
*   _Application members_ can access application data.
    

All the data generated by an application is visible to members and admins of the app and the admins of the organization to which the app belongs. Organization admins can see data for all of the organization's applications.

An organization can have child organizations. These child organizations are allocated user and device account resources from the parent organization. An administrator of the parent organization can create child organizations and manage applications and users for both the parent and child organizations.

### Roles and features

Users can be assigned different roles that grant them the rights to the Platform associated with their assigned roles and capabilities. Those roles and rights are:

*   **Platform roles:**
    
    *   Administrator
        
    *   Developer
        
    *   Insight
        
    *   Consumer
        
*   **Central roles:**
    
    *   AMPLIFY Central Admin
        
*   **Runtime Services roles:**
    
    *   Runtime Services Admin
