# Using Open Declaration to jump to another location in your code

This page describes how to use the Open Declaration feature to jump to another location in your code.

## Introduction

Open declaration allows you to see the source or declaration of the item you are referencing. As an example, when you call a function in your code, you can quickly jump to the place where you originally declared the function. This makes it easy for you to access that function in case you are not using content assist or have not yet documented that function.

If you call a function that was originally declared in another file or even in another project, you can still use Open Declaration as long as you added a project reference to the project containing function.

## Instructions

To jump to a source location in your code:

1.  Place your cursor on the item you are referencing.
    
2.  Press **F3** to jump to the place where you declared the item. (You can also select **Open Declaration** from the **Navigate** menu.)
    

Your cursor automatically jumps to the place where the item was originally declared.
