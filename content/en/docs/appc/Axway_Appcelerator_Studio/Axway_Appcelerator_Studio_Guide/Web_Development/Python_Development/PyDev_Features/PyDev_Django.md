## Django

### Pre-requisites

To get started with Django in PyDev, the pre-requisite is that Django is installed in the Python/Jython/IronPython interpreter you want to use (so, "import Django" must properly work).

If you don't have Django installed, follow the steps from [http://www.djangoproject.com/](http://www.djangoproject.com/).

Note that this tutorial won't teach you Django, only how the Django integration is available in PyDev, so, if you're not familiar with Django, it's useful to learn a bit about how it works and then use this help to know how the PyDev Django integration can help you.

### A bit on the internals

The Django integration in PyDev works through 3 main configurations:

1\. The project must be marked as a Django project inside of PyDev.

2\. A 'DJANGO\_MANAGE\_LOCATION' string substitution variable must point to the project-relative location of manage.py.

3\. A 'DJANGO\_SETTINGS\_MODULE' string substitution variable must contain the name of the settings module in that project.

And that's it, with those properly configured, all the Django-related actions should work (and the steps below will explain how those can be configured).

### Creating a new project

Use the new project wizard through **Ctrl+N > PyDev Django Project** to create a new Django based project.

That wizard will use **django-admin.py start project** to create the project and will properly set the string substitution variables used inside of PyDev so that **DJANGO\_MANAGE\_LOCATION** points to the created manage.py location and the **DJANGO\_SETTINGS\_MODULE** points to the settings module.

## Using the Django integration in an existing project

For an existing project, right-click it and choose 'PyDev > Set as Django project'.

Note that the **DJANGO\_MANAGE\_LOCATION** and **DJANGO\_SETTINGS\_MODULE** will not be set at this time, but when executing an action that needs it, PyDev will ask about it.

## Django actions

Django actions can be accessed by right-clicking a project with the Django configuration and choosing Django > action.

Another option is using (with focus on a PyDev editor):

* **ctrl+2+dj <enter>** to open a dialog with the history of entered actions

* **ctrl+2+dj action\_to\_execute <enter>** to already pass the action to be executed (e.g.: ctrl+2+dj help <enter>)

## Interactive shell with Django

Note that the **Shell with django environment** action will create a shell properly configured with your settings, providing the default features from the PyDev shell, such as code completion, history, context assistants (ctrl+1), making an execfile of the editor, and so forth (see: [Interactive Console](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Web_Development/Python_Development/PyDev_Features/PyDev_Interactive_Console/) for more details).

It can be activated through **ctrl+2+dj shell** (if on a PyDev Editor) or right-clicking the project > **Django > Shell with django environment**.

## Run/Debug as Django

Run as Django/Debug as Django are available (note that they set the --noreload by default).

![run_as_django](/Images/appc/pydev.org/images/django/run_as_django.png)

This will create a default Run configuration so that you may edit it later through run > run configurations (or debug > debug configurations) if you want to change a parameter.

{{% alert title="⚠️ Warning" color="primary" %}}To know how to rerun the last launch, see: Rerun Last Launch on Launching.{{% /alert %}}{{% alert title="⚠️ Warning" color="primary" %}}If the --noreload is not passed, only the parent process will be killed from Eclipse, and the others will only be killed when they'd be reloaded (in other words, on a code-change).{{% /alert %}}

## Run/Debug as Django with auto-reload

If you don't want to see the --noreload flag, please take a look at the [Remote Debugger](/docs/appc/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio/Axway_Appcelerator_Studio_Guide/Web_Development/Python_Development/PyDev_Features/PyDev_Remote_Debugger/) for instructions on how to make the debugging work properly with the auto-reload feature.
