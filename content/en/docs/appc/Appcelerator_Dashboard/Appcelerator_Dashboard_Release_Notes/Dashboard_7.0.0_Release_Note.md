## Dashboard 7.0.0 - 28 September 2018

Dashboard 7.0.0 is a major release, which includes new features, several improvements, and several bug fixes.

## New features

*   Introduced _Teams_, a new facility for grouping your organization's users and apps. Replaces the previous _App Teams_ functionality, allowing administrators to control visibility and rights to Mobile Backend Services in addition to Titanium, APS SDK, and other app types. Existing app teams were migrated to new teams.
    
*   Added _Teams_ view allowing users to view and administrators to create, update, and remove teams and designate a team as default.
    
*   Added Teams controls on the _Add New Member_ form allowing administrators to add the new member to teams and assign their role.
    
*   Added Teams column to the _Members_ view showing the count of teams of which the user is a member and links to view or manage the user's team membership. This view is also accessible from the Actions dropdown to the right of the user's row.
    
*   Added Teams controls on the _Register App for Services_ form allowing users to assign the app to one or more teams. Apps that are not yet associated with a team are still accessible by org administrators and their creators.
    
*   Added Teams section on _App Overview_ view showing the teams to which the app has been assigned.
    
*   Added OS and app version breakdown to AMPLIFY Crash Analytics crash detail view.
    

## Improvements
