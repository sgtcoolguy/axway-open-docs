{"title":"Dashboard 4.4.0","weight":"20"}

Dashboard 4.4.0 is a minor release, which includes behavior changes and a few bug fixes.

## Behavior Changes

* In this release, users will now see a banner providing them with information regarding their trial or license status. For individual users employing the **free trial**, you will see a "days since signup " counter along with a link to billing. **Enterprise trial** users will see a countdown timer and a link to contact your sales rep. Licensed **On-demand** users will not see this banner as your notifications will arrive via email or can be reviewed at [https://billing.appcelerator.com](https://billing.appcelerator.com/). If you ordered your license via an **order form**, you will see the time remaining in the banner along with a link to contact your sales rep.

* Mapbox now enforces map boundary restrictions.

* You can now assign your users one of four user roles: Admin, Developer, Collaborator, and Insight. See User Roles and Features below for more details.

* The default date range for analytics was changed from 7 days to 24 hours.


## Roles and Features

Dashboard 4.4.0 introduces the capability to assign users to different roles that grant them different rights to the dashboard. Those roles and rights are:

In addition to these user roles, you can add the following features to your roles:

* Support

* Test (available for enterprise only)

* Performance management (included to enterprise)
