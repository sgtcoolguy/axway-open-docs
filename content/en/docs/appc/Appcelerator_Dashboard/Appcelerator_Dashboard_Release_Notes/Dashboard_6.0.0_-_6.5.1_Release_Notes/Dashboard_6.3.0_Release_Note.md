## Dashboard 6.3.0 - 11 June 2019

Dashboard 6.3.0 is a minor release, which includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## New features

*   Introduced a daily process to send email notifications to organization administrators when their organization's usage of Application Development or Cloud Capacity entitlements exceeds specific thresholds. A single notification will be sent once the usage of an entitlement exceeds 75% of its entitlement quota. A second will be sent once usage exceeds 90%. A daily notification will be sent if the usage of any entitlement quotas exceeds 100%.
    
*   Added support for custom queries by location and improved display and consistency of analytics views by location.
