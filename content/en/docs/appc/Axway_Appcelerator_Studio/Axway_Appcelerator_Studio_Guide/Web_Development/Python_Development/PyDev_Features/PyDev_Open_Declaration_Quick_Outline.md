{"title":"PyDev Open Declaration Quick Outline","weight":"170"} 

The 'Open Definition Quick Outline' allows you to quickly see (and go to) all the available 'definition' tokens, including:

*   Class definitions
    
*   Method definitions
    
*   Global variables
    
*   Class and instance attributes
    

**KEYBINDING:** Ctrl+Shift+T (with focus on the PyDev editor)

The image below shows the filter applied for all the definitions that started with 'stri'.

It can also be activated from the menu:

![open_decl_menu](/Images/appc/pydev.org/images/open_decl_menu.png)

If it is activated with focus on the editor, it will bring the definitions from the current project and all referencing and referenced projects, and if it is activated from the menu, it will bring the definitions for all the projects in the workspace.
