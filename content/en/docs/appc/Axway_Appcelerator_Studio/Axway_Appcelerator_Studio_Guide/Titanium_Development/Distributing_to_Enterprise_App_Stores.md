## Introduction

Enterprise app stores are private app stores where access to applications is controlled by the company. Employees must be authenticated to download and install internally developed applications. Appcelerator Studio allows you to package Android and iOS applications and upload them to a Mobile Application Management platform that can be published to an enterprise app store. You can publish your application to AirWatch's or MobileIron's platform.

## AirWatch Platform

Before publishing to AirWatch, you need install the AirWatch plugin on Appcelerator Studio. After the plugin is installed, start the publishing process from the right-click context menu. You need to create an AirWatch publish target. A publish target consists of a host URL, username, password and API key associated with an alias. You can create one during the **Target** step of the **Publish to AirWatch** wizard.

You also need the following items to package an application:

*   For Android applications, generate a keypair and certificate to sign your applications. For help, see [Distributing Android apps: Generate keypair and certificate](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Preparing_for_Distribution/Distributing_Android_apps/#Generateakeypairandcertificate).
    
*   For iOS applications, create a distribution certificate and provisioning profile to sign your application. For help, see [Distributing iOS apps](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Preparing_for_Distribution/Distributing_iOS_apps/).
    

### Install the AirWatch Plugin

Appcelerator Studio requires AirWatch integration to be installed as a separate plugin. To install the plugin:

1.  Launch Appcelerator Studio.
    
2.  From the menu bar, select **Help** \> **Install New Software...** The **Install** wizard appears.
    
3.  Click **Add**. A dialog appears asking for the name and location of the update site.
    
    1.  For **Name**, enter 'AirWatch' or something similar.
        
    2.  For **Location**, copy and paste one of the the following URLs:
        
        1.  Release Candidate Build: [http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/airwatch/update/rc/](http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/airwatch/update/rc/)
            
    3.  Click **OK**.
        
4.  An item called **AirWatch Integration** should appear. Select to install it, that is, make sure the box is checked, then click **Finish****.**
    
5.  Follow the rest of the wizard directions to install it. When prompted, restart Studio.
    

### Obtain the Host URL and API Key

In order to publish to AirWatch, you need to obtain a REST API key and endpoint. Retrieve both pieces of information from the AirWatch Web Console.

1.  Login to the [AirWatch Web Console](https://apidev.awmdm.com/AirWatch).
    
2.  In the left navigation bar, click **Groups & Settings** and select **All Settings** to open the **Settings** dialog**.**
    
3.  Under the **System** section, click **Advanced**, then select **API** \> **REST**.
    
4.  Make sure **Enable API Access** is checked if it is not already enabled. Copy the API Key field. You need to paste the value to the API Key field when registering an AirWatch target.
    
5.  Click **Site URLs** in the left navigation bar under the **System** section.
    
6.  Copy the host name of the REST URL field (without the protocol and any paths). You need to paste the value to the Host URL field when registering an AirWatch target. By default, the hostname is apidev-as.awmdm.com.
