## Overview

Titanium mobile needs support for binary data operations. A new buffer type needs to be created that will be used for read / write operations on streams.

A separate spec exists that outlines encoding support for numeric and string values. The [Encoding Spec](/docs/appc/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Contributing_to_Titanium/Platform_Development/Specs/Encoding_Spec/) enables the addition of reading and writing of numeric and string values along with support for specific encoding.

## Definitions

* Buffer - Generally represents temporary storage for data when moving from one location to another (such as reading data off a socket and then writing to a file). In our case, the buffer will be a container for binary data rather than being limited to only string data.

## Proposed Tasks

* Create Buffer data type for use with Stream IO

### Ti.Buffer

In order to support generic handling of Stream operations, all read / write operations will utilize the new buffer type. Buffer type will allow for array style access for individual bytes (IE: myarray\[spe:3\] = 1)

Creating buffer object:

`// the only creation argument supported is size`

`Buffer Ti.createBuffer()` `// buffer is empty with size 0 if no size is specified`

`Buffer Ti.createBuffer({length: x})`

Members:

`/*`

`length is accessed via standard get / set methods. When length is modified, `

`the buffer will be re-sized while preserving existing where possible. If the new buffer size`

`is smaller than the size of the existing data then the existing data will be truncated down to `

`the size of the new buffer.`

`*/`

`int` `length;`

Methods:

`// appends specified buffer to the current buffer. Buffer is grown dynamically to accommodate the `

`// additional data if need be. returns the number of bytes appended`

`int` `append(Buffer sourceBuffer)`

`// same as normal append except this allows appending only <sourceLength> bytes from the `

`// <sourceBuffer> starting at <sourceOffset>. returns the number of bytes appended`

`int` `append(Buffer sourceBuffer,` `int` `sourceOffset,` `int` `sourceLength)`

`// inserts <sourceBuffer> into the current buffer at <offset>. Buffer is grown to accommodate `

`// the new data. returns the number of bytes inserted`

`int` `insert(Buffer sourceBuffer,` `int` `offset)`

`// inserts <sourceLength> amount of data starting at <sourceOffset> from <sourceBuffer> into `

`// current buffer at <offset>. Buffer is grown to accommodate the new data. returns`

`// the number of bytes inserted`

`int` `insert(Buffer sourceBuffer,` `int` `offset,` `int` `sourceOffset,` `int` `sourceLength)`

`// copies the contents of <sourceBuffer> into the current buffer at <offset>. will not `

`// expand buffer if there is not enough room in the current buffer to accomodate all`

`// the requested data from <sourceBuffer>. returns the number of bytes copied`

`int` `copy(Buffer sourceBuffer,` `int` `offset)`

`// copies <sourceLength> contents from <sourceBuffer> starting at <sourceOffset> into the `

`// current buffer at <offset>. will not expand buffer if there is not enough room`

`// in the current buffer to accomodate all the request data from <sourceBuffer>. returns `

`// the number of bytes copied`

`int` `copy(Buffer sourceBuffer,` `int` `offset,` `int` `sourceOffset,` `int` `sourceLength)`

`Buffer clone()` `// create new copy of the current buffer`

`// creates a new buffer from the original buffer contents starting at <offset> `

`// and ending at <offset> + <length>`

`Buffer clone(``int` `offset,` `int` `length)`

`void` `fill(``int` `fillByte)` `// fills buffer with <fillByte>`

`// fills buffer starting from <offset> until <length> number of <fillByte> has `

`// been written or the end of the buffer is reached`

`void` `fill(``int` `fillByte,` `int` `offset,` `int` `length)`

`void` `clear()` `// clears buffer contents but does not change the size of the buffer`

`// releases the space allocated to the buffer, sets length to 0. This is effectively `

`// nothing more than an alias for buffer.length = 0`

`void` `release()`

`String toString()` `// converts buffer to string`

`Blob toBlob()` `// converts buffer to TiBlob`
