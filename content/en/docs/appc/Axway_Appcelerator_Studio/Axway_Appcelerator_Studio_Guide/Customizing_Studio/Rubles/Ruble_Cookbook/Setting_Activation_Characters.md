{"title":"Setting Activation Characters","weight":"100"} 

## Overview

In this recipe we show how it is possible to use a Ruble command to modify the activation characters for the HTML, CSS, and JS editors.

## The Code

Below is a sample to change the activation characters for the CSS editor. The activation characters are set to '.', '#', and ':'. This happens to be the default, so you will not see any change; however, by altering the content of the string in the call to node.put, you can modify the set of characters that will cause content assist to appear automatically.

`require` `'ruble'`

`bundle` `do` `|bundle|`

`bundle.author =` `'Kevin Lindsey'`

`bundle.copyright =` `"Copyright 2011 Appcelerator, Inc. Distributed under the MIT license."`

`bundle.display_name =` `'CSS Prefs'`

`bundle.description =` `"A simple bundle showing how to set CSS preferences"`

`bundle.menu` `"CSS Prefs"`  `do` `|m|`

`m.command` `"Set Activation Characters"`  `do` `|cmd|`

`cmd.invoke` `do` `|ctx|`

`pluginId =` `"com.aptana.editor.css"`

`prefKey =` `"CSS_ACTIVATION_CHARACTERS"`

`node = org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.InstanceScope.``new``.getNode pluginId`

`node.put prefKey,` `".#:"`

`node.flush`

`CONSOLE.puts` `"CSS activation character preference has been updated"`

`end`

`end`

`end`

`end`

## Plugin Ids and Preference Keys

In order to set the activate characters for a specific language, you need to know the editor's plugin id and the associated preference key. Below is a table providing that information. Replace the "pluginId" and "prefKey" assignments in the above example to the setting appropriate for the language you wish to update.
