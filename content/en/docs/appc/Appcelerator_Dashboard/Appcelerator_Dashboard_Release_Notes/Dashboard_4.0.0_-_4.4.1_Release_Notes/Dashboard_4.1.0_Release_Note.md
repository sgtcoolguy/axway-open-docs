    1. Click the Add menu (**+**) in the top navigation bar

    2. Select **Create ArrowDB Datasource**

    3. Enter a name for the ArrowDB datasource

    4. If you have multiple environments, select the environment to enable.

    5. Click **OK**. Dashboard will redirect you to the new ArrowDB datasource.

    4. Click **OK**.

* In the **All** page (formerly the **All Projects** page), added the ability to filter projects by type. Click the **All**, **Apps**, **Arrow** or **ArrowDB** links to view only those types of projects.

## Fixed Issues

* When creating event funnels in the dashboard, some events that can be found under the "Events" tab cannot be found under the "Event Funnels" tab when searching.

* Fixed an issue where favoriting the app did not pin it down to the top of the Apps drop-down list.

* Fixed an issue where the Performance page did not load.
