Click the **iOS** tab to configure the application to use the Apple Push Notification service. Before configuring APN, you need to create a Push Notification Certificate and export it as a PKCS #12 file. For instructions, see [Configuring push services for iOS devices](/docs/appc/Appcelerator_Dashboard/Appcelerator_Dashboard_Guide/Sending_and_Scheduling_Push_Notifications/).

1.  Click **Browse** in the Push Certificate field.
    
2.  Locate the PKCS #12 file with your Push Notification certificate and click **Choose File**.
    
3.  Enter the certificate's password in the **Certificate Password** field.
