{"title":"Alloy Test Apps","weight":"40"}

The Alloy GitHub [repository](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy) includes a number of small [test applications](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/samples/apps) that demonstrates various Alloy features.

To build and run one of the test applications, do the following:

1. Clone the Alloy project locally.

2. Create a new Alloy project, either using Studio or the CLI tools.

3. Copy the contents of the desired sample folder into the newly created Alloy project's /app folder and overwrite any existing files.

4. Build and run the application on a device, simulator, or emulator.


The sample apps are organized in several folders representing the following categories:

* [User Interface](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/User_Interface/)

* [Advanced](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/Advanced/) — Samples in the advanced/ folder demonstrate advanced Alloy topics and approaches, such as advanced styling, using modules, using CommonJS modules, and more.

* [Basics](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/Basics/) — Samples in the basics/ folder demonstrates basic Alloy concepts.

* [Alloy Test Models](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/Alloy_Test_Models/) — Samples in the alloy/test/apps/models/ folder demonstrates using models, collections, and data binding in Alloy.

* [Widgets](/docs/appc/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Test_Apps/Widgets/)


Note that some samples demonstrate platform-specific features that only run on certain platforms.

## Importing and Running an Alloy Test App

To import one of the sample application, first clone the Alloy GitHub project locally:

`git clone https:``//github.com/appcelerator/alloy`

Once you've selected a test app to build and run, you first create a new "blank" Alloy project, and then copy the contents of the sample folder into the /app folder of the newly created Alloy project. You can do this either using Appcelerator Studio or on the command line using the CLI tools, as explained below.

### Using the CLI tools

You can generate a new Alloy project using a test application from the Alloy Github repo. (The source code is copied from the global or local install of the Alloy npm package.)

To create an Alloy application based on a test application, first create a skeleton Titanium project, then run the Alloy new command with the \--testapp <path\_to\_test\_app> option. Pass the option the relative path to the test application after the alloy/test/apps path.

`appc new -t titanium --classic -i com.appc.picker -n AlloyPicker`

`cd` `AlloyPicker`

`appc alloy new --testapp ui``/picker`

Prior to Alloy 1.7.6, you need to manually copy the source code to the new Titanium project:.

Creating a test project

`appc` `new` `-t titanium -n picker_test --id com.yourdomain -d . -url yourdomain.com -p all`

`cd picker_test/`

`cp -r <alloy_repo>/test/apps/ui/picker/ app/`

`appc run -p ios`

### Using Appcelerator Studio

1. To build a sample using **Appcelerator Studio**, first create a new Alloy project by selecting **File** > **New** \> **Mobile App Project**.

  ![new-Alloy-project](/Images/appc/download/attachments/41845629/new-Alloy-project.png)
2. Drag and drop the contents of the desired test app folder from the desktop into the new project's /app folder in Project Explorer.

3. When prompted, select **Copy file and folders** option in the File and Folder Operation dialog and click OK.

4. Select **Yes To All** when asked if you want to overwrite files in the target folder.


You can now build or run the application on a target device, simulator or emulator.
