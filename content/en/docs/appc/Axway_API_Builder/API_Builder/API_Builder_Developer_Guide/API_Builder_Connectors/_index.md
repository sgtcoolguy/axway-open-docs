API Builder 3.x is deprecated

Support for API Builder 3.x will cease on 30 April 2020. Use the [v3 to v4 upgrade guide](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/API_Builder_4x_allOS_en/page/api_builder_v3_to_v4_upgrade_guide.html) to migrate all your applications to [API Builder 4.x](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/API_Builder_4x_allOS_en/page/api_builder_getting_started_guide.html).

Contact [support@axway.com](mailto:support@axway.com) if you require migration assistance.

Connectors are adapters to allow you to read and write data to and from an external data source, such as [Mobile Backend Services](/docs/appc/Mobile_Backend_Services/), MySQL, Salesforce, and MongoDB, or in server memory. You can install a pre-built connector or create your own.
