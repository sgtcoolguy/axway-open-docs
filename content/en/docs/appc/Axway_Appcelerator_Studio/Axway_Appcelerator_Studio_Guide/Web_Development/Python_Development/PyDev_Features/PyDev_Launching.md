## Launching/Debugging Python scripts

### Regular Launch

The easiest way of launching a python file from PyDev is by opening an editor and using the **F9 keybinding**. Through that command, PyDev will create/reuse a **launch** config to run the current editor based on the **current settings of the project** (in other words, if the project is configured as IronPython, it'll use an IronPython interpreter).

Another option would be running using the **context menu**, where you can choose how you want to make the run (in that way, you could run a python project with a Jython interpreter)

### Unit Test Launch

If you use **unit-tests** and want to run only a single unit-test or a few unit-tests of a module, you can use the **Ctrl+F9 keybinding**, which will open a tree where you can choose which test(s) you want to run:

In that dialog, there are some options:

* Extending the filter and pressing 'Enter' will run the filtered tests

* Explicitly selecting the class/tests to run will run those tests

### Debug Launch

To run in debug mode, you can use the **context menu**, where you can choose how you want to make the debug (note that in that way, you could debug a python project with a Jython interpreter)

Another option would be running the last launch in debug mode. See: \`Rerun Last Launch (regular or debug mode)\`\_

### Rerun Last Launch (regular or debug mode)

If you use the F9 and Ctrl+F9 keybindings or launch through the context menu, usually you'll also want to check the default eclipse preferences so that **Ctrl+F11** and **F11** will run your last configuration (otherwise, they'll bring a dialog to run/debug your current editor, which is mostly what's already given by PyDev through F9 and Ctrl+F9).

To do that, open the eclipse preferences (**window > preferences**) and check **"Always launch previously launched application"**, that way, when you use **F11**, your last launch will be repeated in **debug mode**, and with **Ctrl+F11**, it'll be relaunched in the **regular mode**.

Another option would be running the last launch from the menu. You can go to the menu with keybindings (**Alt+R, then 'T' regular run or 'H' for debug run**) and choose some existing launch to be run.

## Debugging

Currently the debugger supports:

* Step in: **F5**

* Step over: **F6**

* Step return: **F7**

* Continue: **F8**

* Breakpoints (with the optional condition)

* Stack view showing multiple threads

* Locals and Globals variable display

* Expressions display

* Temporary display for selection: **Ctrl+Shift+D**

* Hover showing the selected expression evaluation

To add breakpoints, you can double click the left bar or use Ctrl+F10 > Add breakpoint. In a line with an existing breakpoint, Ctrl+F10 will be able to remove the breakpoint, disable it and edit its properties (which can be used to provide conditions for the breakpoint to be hit). Double-clicking an existing breakpoint will remove it.

When you hit a breakpoint, you'll get a view that allows you to inspect the stack, see locals and globals, hover over variables (or select a text to be evaluated) and add expressions.

Note that the program output is displayed in the console, and the errors in the console are hyperlinked back to the file:
