## About this release

## GDPR opt out sample app

We have created a sample app that shows users how to opt out from Analytics (per the GDPR).

To guide you through the GDPR compliance process for you app, we have create a [7.2.0 Sample App](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti720) that demonstrates the usage of the new optedOut property as part of Ti.Analytics.

Here is a practical example: Let's assume, you have a Ti.UI.Switch instance in your app that controls whether or not the user should opt out of Analytics. By default, the user is opted in to Analytics.

``// Create a switch, default optOut status = `false` ``

`const` `switch` `= Ti.UI.createSwitch({ value:` `false` `});`

`// On change, toggle the opt-out property`

`switch``.addEventListener(``'change'``, (event) => {`

`Ti.Analytics.optedOut = event.value;`

`});`

`// ...`

``// For every Analytics event, validate the `Ti.Analytics.optedOut` property. If the user opted out``

`// and you did not validate it, the Analatyics event will be skipped silently.`

`if` `(!Ti.Analytics.optedOut) {`

`Ti.Analytics.featureEvent(``'i_love_gdpr'``, { really:` `true` `});`

`}`

### External Modules
